This design not only preserves\ncritical token characteristics and ensures multi-scale feature fidelity but\nalso enables efficient feature extraction without requiring modifications to\nthe underlying network architecture. In addition, FlexiMo incorporates a\nlightweight channel adaptation module that leverages prior spectral information\nfrom sensors. This mechanism allows the model to process images with varying\nnumbers of channels while maintaining the data's intrinsic physical properties.\nExtensive experiments on diverse multimodal, multi-resolution, and multi-scale\ndatasets demonstrate that FlexiMo significantly enhances model generalization\nand robustness. In particular, our method achieves outstanding performance\nacross a range of downstream tasks, including scene classification, land cover\nclassification, urban building segmentation, and cloud detection. By enabling\nparameter-efficient and physically consistent adaptation, FlexiMo paves the way\nfor more adaptable and effective foundation models in real-world remote sensing\napplications.",

Experimental\nresults show that LRSCLIP improves retrieval accuracy by 10\\%-20\\% over the\nLong-CLIP baseline in the zero-shot long-text cross-modal retrieval task.

In this paper, we introduce a simple\nyet effective pretraining framework for large-scale MCI datasets. Our method,\nnamed Isolated Channel ViT (IC-ViT), patchifies image channels individually and\nthereby enables pretraining for multimodal multi-channel tasks. We show that\nthis channel-wise patchifying is a key technique for MCI processing. More\nimportantly, one can pretrain the IC-ViT on single channels and finetune it on\ndownstream multi-channel datasets. This pretraining framework captures\ndependencies between patches as well as channels and produces robust feature\nrepresentation. Experiments on various tasks and benchmarks, including JUMP-CP\nand CHAMMI for cell microscopy imaging, and So2Sat-LCZ42 for satellite imaging,\nshow that the proposed IC-ViT delivers 4-14 percentage points of performance\nimprovement over existing channel-adaptive approaches. Further, its efficient\ntraining makes it a suitable candidate for large-scale pretraining of\nfoundation models on heterogeneous data.",

Besides, existing text2image methods\nhave struggled to achieve global-scale, multi-resolution controllable, and\nunbounded image generation. To address these challenges, this paper presents\ntwo key contributions: the Git-10M dataset and the Text2Earth foundation model.\nGit-10M is a global-scale image-text dataset comprising 10.5 million image-text\npairs, 5 times larger than the previous largest one. The dataset covers a wide\nrange of geographic scenes and contains resolution information, significantly\nsurpassing existing datasets in both size and diversity. Building on Git-10M,\nwe propose Text2Earth, a 1.3 billion parameter generative foundation model\nbased on the diffusion framework to model global-scale remote sensing scenes.\nText2Earth integrates a resolution guidance mechanism, enabling users to\nspecify image resolutions. A dynamic condition adaptation strategy is proposed\nfor training and inference to improve image quality. Text2Earth excels in\nzero-shot text2image generation and demonstrates robust generalization and\nflexibility across multiple tasks, including unbounded scene construction,\nimage editing, and cross-modal image generation. This robust capability\nsurpasses previous models restricted to the basic fixed size and limited scene\ntypes. On the previous benchmark dataset, Text2Earth outperforms previous\nmodels with an improvement of +26.23 FID and +20.95% Zero-shot Cls-OA\nmetric.Our project page is https://chen-yang-liu.github.io/Text2Earth",

To bridge this gap, we introduce SeaMo, a\nnovel VFM that effectively integrates multimodal and multi-seasonal RS\ninformation. SeaMo leverages a masked image modeling framework to fully exploit\nthe spatial, spectral, and seasonal dimensions of RS data. Specifically, we\nemploy unaligned spatial region selection to capture spatial heterogeneity,\nincorporate multi-source inputs for enhanced multimodal integration, and\nintroduce temporal-multimodal fusion blocks to assimilate seasonal variations\neffectively.

    "abstract": "When given two similar images, humans identify their differences by comparing\nthe appearance ({\\it e.g., color, texture}) with the help of semantics ({\\it\ne.g., objects, relations}). However, mainstream change detection models adopt a\nsupervised training paradigm, where the annotated binary change map is the main\nconstraint. Thus, these methods primarily emphasize the difference-aware\nfeatures between bi-temporal images and neglect the semantic understanding of\nthe changed landscapes, which undermines the accuracy in the presence of noise\nand illumination variations. To this end, this paper explores incorporating\nsemantic priors to improve the ability to detect changes. Firstly, we propose a\nSemantic-Aware Change Detection network, namely SA-CDNet, which transfers the\ncommon knowledge of the visual foundation models ({\\it i.e., FastSAM}) to\nchange detection. Inspired by the human visual paradigm, a novel dual-stream\nfeature decoder is derived to distinguish changes by combining semantic-aware\nfeatures and difference-aware features. Secondly, we design a single-temporal\nsemantic pre-training strategy to enhance the semantic understanding of\nlandscapes, which brings further increments. Specifically, we construct\npseudo-change detection data from public single-temporal remote sensing\nsegmentation datasets for large-scale pre-training, where an extra branch is\nalso introduced for the proxy semantic segmentation task.

    "abstract": "Remote Sensing (RS) is a crucial technology for observing, monitoring, and\ninterpreting our planet, with broad applications across geoscience, economics,\nhumanitarian fields, etc. While artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep\nlearning, has achieved significant advances in RS, unique challenges persist in\ndeveloping more intelligent RS systems, including the complexity of Earth's\nenvironments, diverse sensor modalities, distinctive feature patterns, varying\nspatial and spectral resolutions, and temporal dynamics. Meanwhile, recent\nbreakthroughs in large Foundation Models (FMs) have expanded AI's potential\nacross many domains due to their exceptional generalizability and zero-shot\ntransfer capabilities. However, their success has largely been confined to\nnatural data like images and video, with degraded performance and even failures\nfor RS data of various non-optical modalities. This has inspired growing\ninterest in developing Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs) to address the\ncomplex demands of Earth Observation (EO) tasks, spanning the surface,\natmosphere, and oceans. This survey systematically reviews the emerging field\nof RSFMs. It begins with an outline of their motivation and background,\nfollowed by an introduction of their foundational concepts. It then categorizes\nand reviews existing RSFM studies including their datasets and technical\ncontributions across Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), Visual-Language Models\n(VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and beyond.

    "abstract": "Segment Anything Model (SAM) is an advanced foundational model for image\nsegmentation, which is gradually being applied to remote sensing images (RSIs).\nDue to the domain gap between RSIs and natural images, traditional methods\ntypically use SAM as a source pre-trained model and fine-tune it with fully\nsupervised masks. Unlike these methods, our work focuses on fine-tuning SAM\nusing more convenient and challenging point annotations. Leveraging SAM's\nzero-shot capabilities, we adopt a self-training framework that iteratively\ngenerates pseudo-labels for training. However, if the pseudo-labels contain\nnoisy labels, there is a risk of error accumulation. To address this issue, we\nextract target prototypes from the target dataset and use the Hungarian\nalgorithm to match them with prediction prototypes, preventing the model from\nlearning in the wrong direction. Additionally, due to the complex backgrounds\nand dense distribution of objects in RSI, using point prompts may result in\nmultiple objects being recognized as one. To solve this problem, we propose a\nnegative prompt calibration method based on the non-overlapping nature of\ninstance masks. In brief, we use the prompts of overlapping masks as\ncorresponding negative signals, resulting in refined masks. Combining the above\nmethods, we propose a novel Pointly-supervised Segment Anything Model named\nPointSAM.

Given the limitations of current RSICC methods in expressing general\nfeatures across multi-temporal and spatial scenarios, and their deficiency in\nproviding granular, robust, and precise change descriptions, we introduce a\nnovel change captioning (CC) method based on the foundational knowledge and\nsemantic guidance, which we term Semantic-CC. Semantic-CC alleviates the\ndependency of high-generalization algorithms on extensive annotations by\nharnessing the latent knowledge of foundation models, and it generates more\ncomprehensive and accurate change descriptions guided by pixel-level semantics\nfrom change detection (CD). Specifically, we propose a bi-temporal SAM-based\nencoder for dual-image feature extraction; a multi-task semantic aggregation\nneck for facilitating information interaction between heterogeneous tasks; a\nstraightforward multi-scale change detection decoder to provide pixel-level\nsemantic guidance; and a change caption decoder based on the large language\nmodel (LLM) to generate change description sentences. Moreover, to ensure the\nstability of the joint training of CD and CC, we propose a three-stage training\nstrategy that supervises different tasks at various stages. We validate the\nproposed method on the LEVIR-CC and LEVIR-CD datasets. The experimental results\ncorroborate the complementarity of CD and CC, demonstrating that Semantic-CC\ncan generate more accurate change descriptions and achieve optimal performance\nacross both tasks.",

Indeed, embeddings that don't take into account\nthe spectral, spatial and temporal dimensions of the data as well as the\nirregular or unaligned temporal sampling are of little use for most real world\nuses. As a consequence, we propose an ALIgned Sits Encoder (ALISE), a novel\napproach that leverages the spatial, spectral, and temporal dimensions of\nirregular and unaligned SITS while producing aligned latent representations.\nUnlike SSL models currently available for SITS, ALISE incorporates a flexible\nquery mechanism to project the SITS into a common and learned temporal\nprojection space. Additionally, thanks to a multi-view framework, we explore\nintegration of instance discrimination along a masked autoencoding task to\nSITS. The quality of the produced representation is assessed through three\ndownstream tasks: crop segmentation (PASTIS), land cover segmentation\n(MultiSenGE), and a novel crop change detection dataset. Furthermore, the\nchange detection task is performed without supervision. The results suggest\nthat the use of aligned representations is more effective than previous SSL\nmethods for linear probing segmentation tasks.",

However, collecting, preprocessing, and\nannotating multi-temporal remote sensing images at scale is non-trivial since\nit is expensive and knowledge-intensive. In this paper, we present change data\ngenerators based on generative models, which are cheap and automatic,\nalleviating these data problems. Our main idea is to simulate a stochastic\nchange process over time. We describe the stochastic change process as a\nprobabilistic graphical model (GPCM), which factorizes the complex simulation\nproblem into two more tractable sub-problems, i.e., change event simulation and\nsemantic change synthesis. To solve these two problems, we present Changen2, a\nGPCM with a resolution-scalable diffusion transformer which can generate time\nseries of images and their semantic and change labels from labeled or unlabeled\nsingle-temporal images. Changen2 is a generative change foundation model that\ncan be trained at scale via self-supervision, and can produce change\nsupervisory signals from unlabeled single-temporal images. Unlike existing\nfoundation models, Changen2 synthesizes change data to train task-specific\nfoundation models for change detection. The resulting model possesses inherent\nzero-shot change detection capabilities and excellent transferability.\nExperiments suggest Changen2 has superior spatiotemporal scalability, e.g.,\nChangen2 model trained on 256$^2$ pixel single-temporal images can yield time\nseries of any length and resolutions of 1,024$^2$ pixels. Changen2 pre-trained\nmodels exhibit superior zero-shot performance (narrowing the performance gap to\n3% on LEVIR-CD and approximately 10% on both S2Looking and SECOND, compared to\nfully supervised counterparts) and transferability across multiple types of\nchange tasks.",

However, due\nto the multiplicity of Earth Observation satellites, these models should learn\n\"sensor agnostic\" representations, that generalize across sensor\ncharacteristics with minimal fine-tuning. This is complicated by data\navailability, as low-resolution imagery, such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 data,\nare available in large amounts, while very high-resolution aerial or satellite\ndata is less common. To tackle these challenges, we introduce cross-sensor\nself-supervised training and alignment for remote sensing (X-STARS). We design\na self-supervised training loss, the Multi-Sensor Alignment Dense loss (MSAD),\nto align representations across sensors, even with vastly different\nresolutions. Our X-STARS can be applied to train models from scratch, or to\nadapt large models pretrained on e.g low-resolution EO data to new\nhigh-resolution sensors, in a continual pretraining framework. We collect and\nrelease MSC-France, a new multi-sensor dataset, on which we train our X-STARS\nmodels, then evaluated on seven downstream classification and segmentation\ntasks.

Further, Gemini 1.5\nPro performance continues to improve log-linearly up to the maximum number of\ntested examples on many datasets. We also find open-weights multimodal\nfoundation models like Llama 3.2-Vision do not benefit from the demonstrating\nexamples, highlighting an important gap between open and closed multimodal\nfoundation models.

    "abstract": "Instance segmentation in remote sensing images is a long-standing challenge.\nSince horizontal bounding boxes introduce many interference objects, oriented\nbounding boxes (OBBs) are usually used for instance identification. However,\nbased on ``segmentation within bounding box'' paradigm, current instance\nsegmentation methods using OBBs are overly dependent on bounding box detection\nperformance. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes OBSeg, an accurate and\nfast instance segmentation framework using OBBs. OBSeg is based on box\nprompt-based segmentation foundation models (BSMs), e.g., Segment Anything\nModel. Specifically, OBSeg first detects OBBs to distinguish instances and\nprovide coarse localization information. Then, it predicts OBB prompt-related\nmasks for fine segmentation. Since OBBs only serve as prompts, OBSeg alleviates\nthe over-dependence on bounding box detection performance of current instance\nsegmentation methods using OBBs. Thanks to OBB prompts, OBSeg outperforms other\ncurrent BSM-based methods using HBBs. In addition, to enable BSMs to handle OBB\nprompts, we propose a novel OBB prompt encoder. To make OBSeg more lightweight\nand further improve the performance of lightweight distilled BSMs, a Gaussian\nsmoothing-based knowledge distillation method is introduced. Experiments\ndemonstrate that OBSeg outperforms current instance segmentation methods on\nmultiple datasets in terms of instance segmentation accuracy and has\ncompetitive inference speed.

However, they\nfall short of scalable model architectures, leading to inflexibility and\ncomputational inefficiencies when faced with an increasing number of channels\nand modalities.

To\nevaluate the proposed innovations, we construct GFM-Bench, which serves as a\ncomprehensive benchmark for such geospatial raster data.

Experiments show that pre-trained weights\ndesigned explicitly for Sentinel-2, such as SSL4EO-S12, outperform general\npre-trained weights like ImageNet.

Map-matching aligns noisy, sparsely sampled GPS\ntrajectories with digital road maps to reconstruct accurate vehicle paths.\nTraditional methods rely on geometric proximity, topology, and shortest-path\nheuristics, but they overlook two key factors: (1) drivers may prefer routes\nbased on local road characteristics rather than shortest paths, revealing\nlearnable shared preferences, and (2) GPS noise varies spatially due to\nmultipath effects.

To evaluate the performance of large AI\nvision models, especially Meta's Segment Anything Model (SAM), we implemented\ndifferent instance segmentation pipelines that minimize the changes to SAM to\nleverage its power as a foundation model. A series of prompt strategies was\ndeveloped to test SAM's performance regarding its theoretical upper bound of\npredictive accuracy, zero-shot performance, and domain adaptability through\nfine-tuning. The analysis used two permafrost feature datasets, ice-wedge\npolygons and retrogressive thaw slumps because (1) these landform features are\nmore challenging to segment than manmade features due to their complicated\nformation mechanisms, diverse forms, and vague boundaries; (2) their presence\nand changes are important indicators for Arctic warming and climate change. The\nresults show that although promising, SAM still has room for improvement to\nsupport AI-augmented terrain mapping. The spatial and domain generalizability\nof this finding is further validated using a more general dataset EuroCrop for\nagricultural field mapping.

    "abstract": "Deep learning methods have shown promising performances in remote sensing\nimage change detection (CD). However, existing methods usually train a\ndataset-specific deep network for each dataset. Due to the significant\ndifferences in the data distribution and labeling between various datasets, the\ntrained dataset-specific deep network has poor generalization performances on\nother datasets. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a change adapter\nnetwork (CANet) for a more universal and generalized CD. CANet contains\ndataset-shared and dataset-specific learning modules. The former explores the\ndiscriminative features of images, and the latter designs a lightweight adapter\nmodel, to deal with the characteristics of different datasets in data\ndistribution and labeling. The lightweight adapter can quickly generalize the\ndeep network for new CD tasks with a small computation cost. Specifically, this\npaper proposes an interesting change region mask (ICM) in the adapter, which\ncan adaptively focus on interested change objects and decrease the influence of\nlabeling differences in various datasets. Moreover, CANet adopts a unique batch\nnormalization layer for each dataset to deal with data distribution\ndifferences. Compared with existing deep learning methods, CANet can achieve\nsatisfactory CD performances on various datasets simultaneously. Experimental\nresults on several public datasets have verified the effectiveness and\nadvantages of the proposed CANet on CD. CANet has a stronger generalization\nability, smaller training costs (merely updating 4.1%-7.7% parameters), and\nbetter performances under limited training datasets than other deep learning\nmethods, which also can be flexibly inserted with existing deep models.",

This study\nevaluates the diagnostic performance of these PARS-derived virtual H&E images\nin benign and malignant excisional skin biopsies, including Squamous (SCC),\nBasal (BCC) Cell Carcinoma, and normal skin. Sixteen unstained formalin-fixed\nparaffin-embedded skin excisions were PARS imaged, virtually H&E stained, then\nchemically stained and imaged at 40x.

Inspired by the fined aircraft annotation\nmethods for optical remote sensing images (RSI), we first introduce a\nstructure-based SAR aircraft annotations approach to provide structural and\ncompositional supplement information.

The SCR helps maintain the geometric consistency between the\naircraft structure in SAR imagery and the proposed annotation. In this process,\nthe structural attribute can be disentangled in a geometrically meaningful\nmanner. In conclusion, the MTSGL is presented with the expert-level aircraft\nprior knowledge and structure guided learning paradigm, aiming to comprehend\nthe aircraft concept in a way analogous to the human cognitive process.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on a self-constructed multi-task SAR\naircraft recognition dataset (MT-SARD) and the effective results illustrate the\nsuperiority of robustness and interpretation ability of the proposed MTSGL.",

Restricting evaluation to\nonly canopy trees shrank this gap considerably (Canopy AP50: 0.365), although\nperformance was still far lower than on similar hand-labelled data.

However,\nthe selection of deep learning methods for wildfire prediction remains\nuncertain due to the lack of comparative analysis in a quantitative and\nexplainable manner, crucial for improving prevention measures and refining\nmodels. This study aims to thoroughly compare the performance, efficiency, and\nexplainability of four prevalent deep learning architectures: Autoencoder,\nResNet, UNet, and Transformer-based Swin-UNet. Employing a real-world dataset\nthat includes nearly a decade of remote sensing data from California, U.S.,\nthese models predict the spread of wildfires for the following day. Through\ndetailed quantitative comparison analysis, we discovered that Transformer-based\nSwin-UNet and UNet generally outperform Autoencoder and ResNet, particularly\ndue to the advanced attention mechanisms in Transformer-based Swin-UNet and the\nefficient use of skip connections in both UNet and Transformer-based Swin-UNet,\nwhich contribute to superior predictive accuracy and model interpretability.\nThen we applied XAI techniques on all four models, this not only enhances the\nclarity and trustworthiness of models but also promotes focused improvements in\nwildfire prediction capabilities. The XAI analysis reveals that UNet and\nTransformer-based Swin-UNet are able to focus on critical features such as\n'Previous Fire Mask', 'Drought', and 'Vegetation' more effectively than the\nother two models, while also maintaining balanced attention to the remaining\nfeatures, leading to their superior performance.

However, many existing methods struggle to fully leverage\nfeature heterogeneity and redundancy, thereby limiting their effectiveness. We\nuse the covariance matrix to model the feature heterogeneity and redundancy and\npropose Correlation-Aware Covariance Weighting (CACW) to adjust them. CACW\ncaptures these correlations through the covariance matrix, which is then\nprocessed by a nonlinear function to generate weights for adjustment. Building\nupon CACW, we introduce a general adaptive dual-level weighting mechanism\n(ADWM) to address these challenges from two key perspectives, enhancing a wide\nrange of existing deep-learning methods. First, Intra-Feature Weighting (IFW)\nevaluates correlations among channels within each feature to reduce redundancy\nand enhance unique information. Second, Cross-Feature Weighting (CFW) adjusts\ncontributions across layers based on inter-layer correlations, refining the\nfinal output. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of\nADWM compared to recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Furthermore, we\nvalidate the effectiveness of our approach through generality experiments,\nredundancy visualization, comparison experiments, key variables and complexity\nanalysis, and ablation studies.

Remote sensing based\nforest health monitoring, oftentimes, relies on supervised machine learning\nalgorithms that require labeled training data. Monitoring temporal patterns\nthrough time series analysis offers a potential alternative for earlier\ndetection of disturbance but requires substantial storage resources. This study\ninvestigates the potential of a Deep Learning algorithm based on a Long Short\nTerm Memory (LSTM) Autoencoder for the detection of anomalies in forest health\n(e.g. bark beetle outbreaks), utilizing Sentinel-2 time series data. This\napproach is an alternative to supervised machine learning methods, avoiding the\nnecessity for labeled training data. Furthermore, it is more memory-efficient\nthan other time series analysis approaches, as a robust model can be created\nusing only a 26-week-long time series as input. In this study, we monitored\npure stands of spruce in Thuringia, Germany, over a 7-year period from 2018 to\nthe end of 2024.

And landslide\ndetection using DL urgently needs a benchmark dataset to evaluate the\ngeneralization ability of the latest models. To solve the above problems, we\nconstruct a Large-scale Multi-source High-resolution Landslide Dataset (LMHLD)\nfor Landslide Detection based on DL. LMHLD collects remote sensing images from\nfive different satellite sensors across seven study areas worldwide: Wenchuan,\nChina (2008); Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (2011); Gorkha, Nepal (2015); Jiuzhaigou,\nChina (2015); Taiwan, China (2018); Hokkaido, Japan (2018); Emilia-Romagna,\nItaly (2023). The dataset includes a total of 25,365 patches, with different\npatch sizes to accommodate different landslide scales. Additionally, a training\nmodule, LMHLDpart, is designed to accommodate landslide detection tasks at\nvarying scales and to alleviate the issue of catastrophic forgetting in\nmulti-task learning.

Therefore, self-positioning of UAVs in GPS-denied environments\nhas become a critical objective. Some methods obtain geolocation information in\nGPS-denied environments by matching ground objects in the UAV viewpoint with\nremote sensing images.

Recent advancements in deep learning\nhave catalyzed the evolution of automated methods for identifying first-break.\nNevertheless, the complexity of seismic data acquisition and the requirement\nfor detailed, expert-driven labeling often result in outliers and potential\nmislabeling within manually labeled datasets. These issues can negatively\naffect the training of neural networks, necessitating algorithms that handle\noutliers or mislabeled data effectively. We introduce the Simultaneous Picking\nand Refinement (SPR) algorithm, designed to handle datasets plagued by outlier\nsamples or even noisy labels.

Intra-site picking experiments and\ncross-site generalization experiments on publicly available data confirm our\nmethod's performance in identifying first-break and its generalization across\ndifferent sites.

Ultimately, a\ntwo-way strong spatial feature mapping between non-well locations and well\nlocations is achieved. Additionally, to reduce the dependence on well-log\nlabels, we combine the semi-supervised learning strategy with a low-frequency\nmodel, further enhancing the robustness of the method. Experimental results on\nboth synthetic example and field data demonstrate that the proposed method\nsignificantly improves lateral continuity and inversion accuracy compared to\none- and two-dimensional deep learning techniques.",

Throughout the history of SAR ATR\nresearch, there have been only a number of small datasets, mainly including\ntargets like ships, airplanes, buildings, etc. There is only one vehicle\ndataset MSTAR collected in the 1990s, which has been a valuable source for SAR\nATR.

It marks a substantial advancement in\ndataset scale and diversity, comprising over 190,000 well-annotated samples, 10\ntimes larger than its predecessor, the famous MSTAR.

In this work, we introduce Open-Vocabulary Remote\nSensing Image Semantic Segmentation (OVRSISS), which aims to segment arbitrary\nsemantic classes in remote sensing images. To address the lack of OVRSISS\ndatasets, we develop LandDiscover50K, a comprehensive dataset of 51,846 images\ncovering 40 diverse semantic classes. In addition, we propose a novel framework\nnamed GSNet that integrates domain priors from special remote sensing models\nand versatile capabilities of general vision-language models. Technically,\nGSNet consists of a Dual-Stream Image Encoder (DSIE), a Query-Guided Feature\nFusion (QGFF), and a Residual Information Preservation Decoder (RIPD). DSIE\nfirst captures comprehensive features from both special models and general\nmodels in dual streams. Then, with the guidance of variable vocabularies, QGFF\nintegrates specialist and generalist features, enabling them to complement each\nother. Finally, RIPD is proposed to aggregate multi-source features for more\naccurate mask predictions. Experiments show that our method outperforms other\nmethods by a large margin, and our proposed LandDiscover50K improves the\nperformance of OVRSISS methods. The proposed dataset and method will be made\npublicly available at https://github.com/yecy749/GSNet.",

Among the many variables\ncaptured through satellite sensors, Land Surface Temperature (LST) plays a\ncritical role in understanding key environmental processes. However, obtaining\nhigh-resolution LST data remains a challenge, as satellite sensors often face a\ntrade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions. In response,\nSpatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) has emerged as a powerful method to integrate two\nsatellite data sources, one providing high spatial but low temporal resolution,\nand the other offering high temporal but low spatial resolution. Although a\nrange of STF techniques have been proposed, from traditional methods to\ncutting-edge deep learning (DL) models, most have focused on surface\nreflectance, with limited application to LST estimation. DL approaches, in\nparticular, show promise in improving the spatial and temporal resolutions of\nLST by capturing complex, non-linear relationships between input and output LST\ndata. This paper offers a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in\nDL-based STF techniques for LST estimation. We analyze key research\ndevelopments, mathematically formulate the STF problem, and introduce a novel\ntaxonomy for DL-based STF methods. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges faced\nby current methods and highlight future research directions. In addition, we\npresent the first open-source benchmark STF dataset for LST estimation,\nconsisting of 51 pairs of MODIS-Landsat images spanning from 2013 to 2024. To\nsupport our findings, we conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art\nmethods and present both quantitative and qualitative assessments.

We\nalso quantify the impact of varying numbers of SLC images on height estimation\naccuracy, aiming to inform future satellite operations and optimize data\ncollection strategies.

Currently, the combination of remote\nsensing data and deep learning techniques has shown outstanding performance in\ncropland mapping. However, those approaches require massive precise labels,\nwhich are labor-intensive. To reduce the label cost, this study presented a\nweakly supervised framework considering multi-temporal information for\nlarge-scale cropland mapping. Specifically, we extract high-quality labels\naccording to their consistency among global land cover (GLC) products to\nconstruct the supervised learning signal. On the one hand, to alleviate the\noverfitting problem caused by the model's over-trust of remaining errors in\nhigh-quality labels, we encode the similarity/aggregation of cropland in the\nvisual/spatial domain to construct the unsupervised learning signal, and take\nit as the regularization term to constrain the supervised part. On the other\nhand, to sufficiently leverage the plentiful information in the samples without\nhigh-quality labels, we also incorporate the unsupervised learning signal in\nthese samples, enriching the diversity of the feature space. After that, to\ncapture the phenological features of croplands, we introduce dense satellite\nimage time series (SITS) to extend the proposed framework in the temporal\ndimension. We also visualized the high dimensional phenological features to\nuncover how multi-temporal information benefits cropland extraction, and\nassessed the method's robustness under conditions of data scarcity. The\nproposed framework has been experimentally validated for strong adaptability\nacross three study areas (Hunan Province, Southeast France, and Kansas) in\nlarge-scale cropland mapping, and the internal mechanism and temporal\ngeneralizability are also investigated.",

These methods utilize convolution to extract intricate\nlocal features and attention mechanisms to gather long-range information,\nimproving the overall comprehension of the scene. However, a common drawback of\nthese approaches is that the resulting images often suffer from blurriness,\nartifacts, and inconsistencies. This is partly because attention mechanisms\napply weights to all features based on generalized similarity scores, which can\ninadvertently introduce noise and irrelevant details from cloud-covered areas.\nTo overcome this limitation and better capture relevant distant context, we\nintroduce a novel approach named Attentive Contextual Attention (AC-Attention).\nThis method enhances conventional attention mechanisms by dynamically learning\ndata-driven attentive selection scores, enabling it to filter out noise and\nirrelevant features effectively. By integrating the AC-Attention module into\nthe DSen2-CR cloud removal framework, we significantly improve the model's\nability to capture essential distant information, leading to more effective\ncloud removal. Our extensive evaluation of various datasets shows that our\nmethod outperforms existing ones regarding image reconstruction quality.\nAdditionally, we conducted ablation studies by integrating AC-Attention into\nmultiple existing methods and widely used network architectures.

We developed a framework for two challenging sub-datasets of the\nrecently publicly available BenthicNet dataset using Bayesian neural networks,\nMonte Carlo dropout inference sampling, and a proposed single last-layer\ncommittee machine. This approach resulted with a > 95% reduction of network\nparameters to obtain per-sample uncertainties while obtaining near-identical\nperformance compared to computationally more expensive strategies such as\nBayesian neural networks, Monte Carlo dropout, and deep ensembles.

    "abstract": "Climate change is intensifying rainfall extremes, making high-resolution\nprecipitation projections crucial for society to better prepare for impacts\nsuch as flooding. However, current Global Climate Models (GCMs) operate at\nspatial resolutions too coarse for localized analyses. To address this\nlimitation, deep learning-based statistical downscaling methods offer promising\nsolutions, providing high-resolution precipitation projections with a moderate\ncomputational cost. In this work, we introduce a bias-informed conditional\ndiffusion model for statistical downscaling of precipitation. Specifically, our\nmodel leverages a conditional diffusion approach to learn distribution priors\nfrom large-scale, high-resolution precipitation datasets. The long-tail\ndistribution of precipitation poses a unique challenge for training diffusion\nmodels; to address this, we apply gamma correction during preprocessing.\nAdditionally, to correct biases in the downscaled results, we employ a\nguided-sampling strategy to enhance bias correction. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that the proposed model achieves highly accurate results in an 8\ntimes downscaling setting, outperforming previous deterministic methods.

Although numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems have\nadvanced, forecasting at the subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) scale, spanning 2 to\n6 weeks, remains challenging due to the chaotic and sparse atmospheric signals\nat this interval. Even state-of-the-art deep learning models struggle to\noutperform simple climatology models in this domain. This paper identifies that\noptimization, instead of network structure, could be the root cause of this\nperformance gap, and then we develop a novel multi-stage optimization strategy\nto close the gap.

However, the lack of\nlarge-scale, high-quality training samples has become a major bottleneck in\nadvancing phytoplankton tracking. In this paper, we propose a challenging\nbenchmark dataset, Multiple Phytoplankton Tracking (MPT), which covers diverse\nbackground information and variations in motion during observation. The dataset\nincludes 27 species of phytoplankton and zooplankton, 14 different backgrounds\nto simulate diverse and complex underwater environments, and a total of 140\nvideos. To enable accurate real-time observation of phytoplankton, we introduce\na multi-object tracking method, Deviation-Corrected Multi-Scale Feature Fusion\nTracker(DSFT), which addresses issues such as focus shifts during tracking and\nthe loss of small target information when computing frame-to-frame similarity.\nSpecifically, we introduce an additional feature extractor to predict the\nresiduals of the standard feature extractor's output, and compute multi-scale\nframe-to-frame similarity based on features from different layers of the\nextractor. Extensive experiments on the MPT have demonstrated the validity of\nthe dataset and the superiority of DSFT in tracking phytoplankton, providing an\neffective solution for phytoplankton monitoring.",

Traditionally, such simulations are\nconducted using coastal ocean circulation models such as the Regional Ocean\nModeling System (ROMS), which usually runs on an HPC cluster with multiple CPU\ncores.

However, the vanilla EnKF\nframework is not well-defined when perturbations are nonlinear. We study two\nnon-linear extensions of the vanilla EnKF - dubbed the conditional-Gaussian\nEnKF (CG-EnKF) and the normal score EnKF (NS-EnKF) - which sidestep assumptions\nof linearity by constructing the Kalman gain matrix with the `conditional\nGaussian' update formula in place of the traditional one. We then compare these\nmodels against a state-of-the-art deep learning based particle filter called\nthe score filter (SF). This model uses an expensive score diffusion model for\nestimating densities and also requires a strong assumption on the perturbation\noperator for validity. In our comparison, we find that CG-EnKF and NS-EnKF\ndramatically outperform SF for a canonical problem in high-dimensional\nmultiscale data assimilation given by the Lorenz-96 system. Our analysis also\ndemonstrates that the CG-EnKF and NS-EnKF can handle highly non-Gaussian\nadditive noise perturbations, with the latter typically outperforming the\nformer.",

These are\nbenchmarked with the estimate from a commercial service X by evaluation of\n15-minute ground GHI data from 53 ground stations over 1.5 years during\n2022-2023. The results show that the four models exhibit comparable overall MAE\nperformance to the service X. The best model is LightGBM with an overall MAE of\n78.58 W/sqm and RMSE of 118.97 W/sqm, while the service X achieves the lowest\nMAE, RMSE, and MBE in cloudy condition. Obtaining re-analyzed MERRA-2 data for\nthe whole Thailand region is not economically feasible for deployment. When\nremoving these features, the Informer model has a winning performance in MAE of\n78.67 W/sqm. The obtained performance aligns with existing literature by taking\nthe climate zone and time granularity of data into consideration.

Each variable, from temperature to precipitation to wind, all influence\nthe path the environment will take. As a result, all models tend to rapidly\nlose accuracy as the temporal range of their forecasts increase. Classical\nforecasting methods use a myriad of physics-based, numerical, and stochastic\ntechniques to predict the change in weather variables over time.

This hybrid approach\ncircumvents the framing choices and accelerates the attribution process, paving\nthe way for operational anticipated global forecast-based attribution.

Deep\nlearning offers promise in discerning these complex patterns within expansive\nspatial datasets, yet the lack of standardized protocols has hindered\nconsistent comparisons across studies.\n  To address this gap, we introduce ClimDetect, a standardized dataset\ncomprising 1.17M daily climate snapshots paired with target climate change\nindicator variables. The dataset is curated from both CMIP6 climate model\nsimulations and real-world observation-assimilated reanalysis datasets (ERA5,\nJRA-3Q, and MERRA-2), and is designed to enhance model accuracy in detecting\nclimate change signals. ClimDetect integrates various input and target\nvariables used in previous research, ensuring comparability and consistency\nacross studies. We also explore the application of vision transformers (ViT) to\nclimate data -- a novel approach that, to our knowledge, has not been attempted\nbefore for climate change detection tasks. Our open-access data serve as a\nbenchmark for advancing climate science by enabling end-to-end model\ndevelopment and evaluation.

However, GPS may not always be available outdoors because it is\nvulnerable to natural interference and malicious jamming attacks. Thus, an\nalternative navigation system is required when the use of GPS is restricted or\nprohibited. To this end, we present a novel method that utilizes an Unmanned\nAerial Vehicle (UAV) to assist in localizing USVs in GNSS-restricted marine\nenvironments. In our approach, the UAV flies along the shoreline at a\nconsistent altitude, continuously tracking and detecting the USV using a deep\nlearning-based approach on camera images. Subsequently, triangulation\ntechniques are applied to estimate the USV's position relative to the UAV,\nutilizing geometric information and datalink range from the UAV. We propose\nadjusting the UAV's camera angle based on the pixel error between the USV and\nthe image center throughout the localization process to enhance accuracy.\nAdditionally, visual measurements are integrated into an Extended Kalman Filter\n(EKF) for robust state estimation. To validate our proposed method, we utilize\na USV equipped with onboard sensors and a UAV equipped with a camera. A\nheterogeneous robotic interface is established to facilitate communication\nbetween the USV and UAV. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through a\nseries of experiments conducted during the ``Muhammad Bin Zayed International\nRobotic Challenge (MBZIRC-2024)'' in real marine environments, incorporating\nnoisy measurements and ocean disturbances.

Finally, the addition of the Stokes drift and a wind\ndrift factor (WDF), improved the Lagrangian simulation performance in skill and\nspeed, especially in high wind (>10 m/s) and/or Stokes drift regimes (>0.15\nm/s). The optimal WDF for the OpenMetBuoy-v2021 is found to be ~1.8\\% and\n~2.3\\% for simulations including and excluding Stokes drift forcing\nrespectively. To further improve the incorporation of Stokes drift and direct\nwind drag on the trajectory simulations, a more physically based solution is\nadvised as there are still numerous wind and wave related processes that remain\nunresolved, like wave-current interactions and vertical shear.\n  To statistically strengthen the conclusions from this research, incorporating\nadditional observed drifter trajectories would be highly favourable.",

This hydrodynamics is very difficult to measure by in situ or\nremote sensing means. High-frequency coastal radars can provide a synoptic and\nnear-real-time view of such a complex circulation, but the classical processing\nalgorithms are not adapted to the extreme situation of strongly sheared\ncurrents. We propose an improved high-resolution direction-finding technique\nfor the azimuthal processing of such radar data. It uses phased-array systems\nand combines the advantages of the usual beam-forming technique to eliminate\nmany problems related to the distortion of Doppler spectra by extreme currents.\nThe method is evaluated with a unique data set of radar measurements at two\nradar frequencies (13 and 24.5 MHz) and three spatial resolutions (200, 750,\nand 1500 m). The radar-based surface currents are analyzed in the light of a\nhigh-resolution numerical model and also compared with in situ measurements.\nWhile high azimuthal resolution can be achieved in this way, it is shown that\nthe typical range resolutions of 750 and 1500 m are insufficient to account for\nthe strong spatial variations of the surface current at some specific times and\nlocations.",

While AIS tracks the location of tug and\ntow vessels, it does not monitor the presence or number of barges transported\nby those vessels. Understanding the number and types of barges conveyed along\nriver segments, between ports, and at ports is crucial for estimating the\nquantities of freight transported on the nation's waterways. This insight is\nalso valuable for waterway management and infrastructure operations impacting\nareas such as targeted dredging operations, and data-driven resource\nallocation. Labeled sample data was generated using observations from traffic\ncameras located along key river segments and matched to AIS data records. A\nsample of 164 vessels representing up to 42 barge convoys per vessel was used\nfor model development. The methodology involved first predicting barge presence\nand then predicting barge quantity. Features derived from the AIS data included\nspeed measures, vessel characteristics, turning measures, and interaction\nterms. For predicting barge presence, the AdaBoost model achieved an F1 score\nof 0.932. For predicting barge quantity, the Random Forest combined with an\nAdaBoost ensemble model achieved an F1 score of 0.886. Bayesian optimization\nwas used for hyperparameter tuning.

AIS data offers valuable information on the activity of the\ninternational fleet worldwide. In the context of the new international\nagreements, it is a valuable source to monitor shipping, fishing and the\npotential impact in marine life among other aspects. Here we have focused on\nthe Arctic shipping in recent years, which is rapidly growing, particularly\naround the Northeastern and Northwest Passage coastal routes, providing an\nopportunity for the design of shorter shipping routes and reduced greenhouse\ngas emissions from transport of goods, but at a risk of impacts on the Arctic\necosystem.",

Measurements were organized to assess the possible\nnegative impact of noise from hovercraft on fish and birds in wildlife\npreserve.

To ensure meaningful insights, input\nvariables must be carefully chosen to match the study objectives and the\necological requirements of the target species.

PO data are invaluable for understanding species distributions\nand their dynamics, but their use in a Species Distribution Model (SDM) is\ncurtailed by sampling biases and the lack of information on absences. Poisson\npoint processes are widely used for SDMs, with Maxent being one of the most\npopular methods. Maxent maximises the entropy of a probability distribution\nacross sites as a function of predefined transformations of variables, called\nfeatures. In contrast, neural networks and deep learning have emerged as a\npromising technique for automatic feature extraction from complex input\nvariables. Arbitrarily complex transformations of input variables can be\nlearned from the data efficiently through backpropagation and stochastic\ngradient descent (SGD). In this paper, we propose DeepMaxent, which harnesses\nneural networks to automatically learn shared features among species, using the\nmaximum entropy principle. To do so, it employs a normalised Poisson loss where\nfor each species, presence probabilities across sites are modelled by a neural\nnetwork. We evaluate DeepMaxent on a benchmark dataset known for its spatial\nsampling biases, using PO data for calibration and presence-absence (PA) data\nfor validation across six regions with different biological groups and\ncovariates. Our results indicate that DeepMaxent performs better than Maxent\nand other leading SDMs across all regions and taxonomic groups.

In particular, we tackle a challenging version of this task,\nwhere we learn from presence-only data in a community-sourced dataset, model a\nlarge number of species simultaneously, and do not use any additional\nenvironmental information. Previous work has used neural implicit\nrepresentations to construct models that achieve promising results.

Sparsity is a commonly encountered challenge with percent cover data.\nResponses are typically recorded as percentages covered per plot, though some\nspecies may be completely absent or present, i.e., have 0% or 100% cover\nrespectively, rendering the use of beta distribution inadequate.\n  4. We propose two JSDMs suitable for percent cover data, namely a hurdle beta\nmodel and an ordered beta model. We compare the two proposed approaches to a\nbeta distribution for shifted responses, transformed presence-absence data, and\nan ordinal model for percent cover classes. Results demonstrate the hurdle beta\nJSDM was generally the most accurate at retrieving the latent variables and\npredicting ecological percent cover data.",

However, the available data often lacks information on confirmed\nspecies absence and is limited to opportunistically sampled, presence-only\nobservations. To overcome this limitation, a common approach is to employ\npseudo-absences, which are specific geographic locations designated as negative\nsamples. While pseudo-absences are well-established for single-species\ndistribution models, their application in the context of multi-species neural\nnetworks remains underexplored. Notably, the significant class imbalance\nbetween species presences and pseudo-absences is often left unaddressed.\nMoreover, the existence of different types of pseudo-absences (e.g., random and\ntarget-group background points) adds complexity to the selection process.\nDetermining the optimal combination of pseudo-absences types is difficult and\ndepends on the characteristics of the data, particularly considering that\ncertain types of pseudo-absences can be used to mitigate geographic biases. In\nthis paper, we demonstrate that these challenges can be effectively tackled by\nintegrating pseudo-absences in the training of multi-species neural networks\nthrough modifications to the loss function.

Building an automated\ndesign framework is challenging due to the complexities of representing glider\nshapes and the high computational costs associated with modeling complex\nsolid-fluid interactions. In this work, we introduce an AI-enhanced automated\ncomputational framework designed to overcome these limitations by enabling the\ncreation of underwater robots with non-trivial hull shapes. Our approach\ninvolves an algorithm that co-optimizes both shape and control signals,\nutilizing a reduced-order geometry representation and a differentiable\nneural-network-based fluid surrogate model. This end-to-end design workflow\nfacilitates rapid iteration and evaluation of hydrodynamic performance, leading\nto the discovery of optimal and complex hull shapes across various control\nsettings. We validate our method through wind tunnel experiments and swimming\npool gliding tests, demonstrating that our computationally designed gliders\nsurpass manually designed counterparts in terms of energy efficiency. By\naddressing challenges in efficient shape representation and neural fluid\nsurrogate models, our work paves the way for the development of highly\nefficient underwater gliders, with implications for long-range ocean\nexploration and environmental monitoring.",

Traditional numerical\nweather prediction (NWP) models struggle with extreme heat for medium-range and\nsubseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) timescales. Meanwhile, artificial\nintelligence-based weather prediction (AIWP) models are progressing rapidly.\nHowever, it is largely unknown how well AIWP models forecast extremes,\nespecially for medium-range and S2S timescales. This study investigates 2-m\ntemperature forecasts for 60 heat waves across the four boreal seasons and over\nfour CONUS regions at lead times up to 20 days, using two AIWP models (Google\nGraphCast and Pangu-Weather) and one traditional NWP model (NOAA United\nForecast System Global Ensemble Forecast System (UFS GEFS)). First, case study\nanalyses show that both AIWP models and the UFS GEFS exhibit consistent cold\nbiases on regional scales in the 5-10 days of lead time before heat wave onset.\nGraphCast is the more skillful AIWP model, outperforming UFS GEFS and\nPangu-Weather in most locations. Next, the two AIWP models are isolated and\nanalyzed across all heat waves and seasons, with events split among the model's\ntesting (2018-2023) and training (1979-2017) periods. There are cold biases\nbefore and during the heat waves in both models and all seasons, except\nPangu-Weather in winter, which exhibits a mean warm bias before heat wave\nonset. Overall, results offer encouragement that AIWP models may be useful for\nmedium-range and S2S predictability of extreme heat.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities\nacross various natural language processing tasks. Their ability to process and\ngenerate viable text and code has made them ubiquitous in many fields, while\ntheir deployment as knowledge bases and \"reasoning\" tools remains an area of\nongoing research. In geography, a growing body of literature has been focusing\non evaluating LLMs' geographical knowledge and their ability to perform spatial\nreasoning. However, very little is still known about the internal functioning\nof these models, especially about how they process geographical information.\n  In this chapter, we establish a novel framework for the study of geospatial\nmechanistic interpretability - using spatial analysis to reverse engineer how\nLLMs handle geographical information. Our aim is to advance our understanding\nof the internal representations that these complex models generate while\nprocessing geographical information - what one might call \"how LLMs think about\ngeographic information\" if such phrasing was not an undue anthropomorphism.\n  We first outline the use of probing in revealing internal structures within\nLLMs. We then introduce the field of mechanistic interpretability, discussing\nthe superposition hypothesis and the role of sparse autoencoders in\ndisentangling polysemantic internal representations of LLMs into more\ninterpretable, monosemantic features. In our experiments, we use spatial\nautocorrelation to show how features obtained for placenames display spatial\npatterns related to their geographic location and can thus be interpreted\ngeospatially, providing insights into how these models process geographical\ninformation. We conclude by discussing how our framework can help shape the\nstudy and use of foundation models in geography.",

Particularly cloud-related\nparameterizations remain a major source of uncertainty in climate projections.\nWhile hybrid Earth system models (ESMs) with machine learning-based\nparameterizations could improve current ESMs, deep learning approaches often\nlack interpretability, physical consistency, and computational efficiency.\nFurthermore, most data-driven parameterizations are trained in a stand-alone\nfashion and fail within ESMs, partly due to the difficulty of tuning the ESM to\naccommodate new, non-traditional schemes. In this study, we introduce a novel\ntwo-step pipeline for improving a climate model with data-driven\nparameterizations. First, we incorporate a physically consistent, data-driven\ncloud cover parameterization into the ICON global atmospheric model. The\nparameterization, a diagnostic equation derived from storm-resolving\nsimulations via symbolic regression, retains the interpretability and\nefficiency of traditional parameterizations while improving fidelity. Second,\nwe introduce an automated, gradient-free tuning procedure to recalibrate the\nnew climate model with Earth observations. We employ the Nelder-Mead algorithm\nand progressively increase simulation length, making our approach simple,\ncomputationally efficient, and easily extendable to other ESMs. The tuned\nhybrid model significantly reduces some long-standing biases in cloud cover and\nradiative budgets, particularly over regions such as the Southern Ocean and the\nsubtropical stratocumulus regions.

We present Knowledge-Informed Irrigation Mapping (KIIM), a\nnovel Swin-Transformer based approach that uses (i) a specialized projection\nmatrix to encode crop to irrigation probability, (ii) a spatial attention map\nto identify agricultural lands from non-agricultural lands, (iii)\nbi-directional cross-attention to focus complementary information from\ndifferent modalities, and (iv) a weighted ensemble for combining predictions\nfrom images and crop information. Our experimentation on five states in the US\nshows up to 22.9\\% (IoU) improvement over baseline with a 71.4% (IoU)\nimprovement for hard-to-classify drip irrigation. In addition, we propose a\ntwo-phase transfer learning approach to enhance cross-state irrigation mapping,\nachieving a 51% IoU boost in a state with limited labeled data.

    "abstract": "Monocular height estimation (MHE) from very-high-resolution (VHR) remote\nsensing imagery via deep learning is notoriously challenging due to the lack of\nsufficient structural information. Conventional digital elevation models\n(DEMs), typically derived from airborne LiDAR or multi-view stereo, remain\ncostly and geographically limited. Recently, models trained on synthetic data\nand refined through domain adaptation have shown remarkable performance in MHE,\nyet it remains unclear how these models make predictions or how reliable they\ntruly are. In this paper, we investigate a state-of-the-art MHE model trained\npurely on synthetic data to explore where the model looks when making height\npredictions. Through systematic analyses, we find that the model relies heavily\non shadow cues, a factor that can lead to overestimation or underestimation of\nheights when shadows deviate from expected norms. Furthermore, the inherent\ndifficulty of evaluating regression tasks with the human eye underscores\nadditional limitations of purely synthetic training. To address these issues,\nwe propose a novel correction pipeline that integrates sparse, imperfect global\nLiDAR measurements (ICESat-2) with deep-learning outputs to improve local\naccuracy and achieve spatially consistent corrections. Our method comprises two\nstages: pre-processing raw ICESat-2 data, followed by a random forest-based\napproach to densely refine height estimates. Experiments in three\nrepresentative urban regions -- Saint-Omer, Tokyo, and Sao Paulo -- reveal\nsubstantial error reductions, with mean absolute error (MAE) decreased by\n22.8\\%, 6.9\\%, and 4.9\\%, respectively. These findings highlight the critical\nrole of shadow awareness in synthetic data-driven models and demonstrate how\nfusing imperfect real-world LiDAR data can bolster the robustness of MHE,\npaving the way for more reliable and scalable 3D mapping solutions.",

Federated learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling collaborative\nmodel training across decentralized RS data sources without exposing raw data.\nHowever, there lacks a realistic federated dataset and benchmark in RS. Prior\nworks typically rely on manually partitioned single dataset, which fail to\ncapture the heterogeneity and scale of real-world RS data, and often use\ninconsistent experimental setups, hindering fair comparison. To address this\ngap, we propose a realistic federated RS dataset, termed FedRS. FedRS consists\nof eight datasets that cover various sensors and resolutions and builds 135\nclients, which is representative of realistic operational scenarios. Data for\neach client come from the same source, exhibiting authentic federated\nproperties such as skewed label distributions, imbalanced client data volumes,\nand domain heterogeneity across clients. These characteristics reflect\npractical challenges in federated RS and support evaluation of FL methods at\nscale. Based on FedRS, we implement 10 baseline FL algorithms and evaluation\nmetrics to construct the comprehensive FedRS-Bench. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that FL can consistently improve model performance over training on\nisolated data silos, while revealing performance trade-offs of different\nmethods under varying client heterogeneity and availability conditions.

Fine-tuning such models for downstream\ntasks is also challenging, often demanding considerable memory and storage.

    "abstract": "Remote sensing images (RSIs) capture both natural and human-induced changes\non the Earth's surface, serving as essential data for environmental monitoring,\nurban planning, and resource management. Semantic segmentation (SS) of RSIs\nenables the fine-grained interpretation of surface features, making it a\ncritical task in remote sensing analysis. With the increasing diversity and\nvolume of RSIs collected by sensors on various platforms, traditional\nprocessing methods struggle to maintain efficiency and accuracy. In response,\ndeep learning (DL) has emerged as a transformative approach, enabling\nsubstantial advances in remote sensing image semantic segmentation (RSISS) by\nautomating feature extraction and improving segmentation accuracy across\ndiverse modalities. This paper revisits the evolution of DL-based RSISS by\ncategorizing existing approaches into four stages: the early pixel-based\nmethods, the prevailing patch-based and tile-based techniques, and the emerging\nimage-based strategies enabled by foundation models. We analyze these\ndevelopments from the perspective of feature extraction and learning\nstrategies, revealing the field's progression from pixel-level to tile-level\nand from unimodal to multimodal segmentation. Furthermore, we conduct a\ncomprehensive evaluation of nearly 40 advanced techniques on a unified dataset\nto quantitatively characterize their performance and applicability. This review\noffers a holistic view of DL-based SS for RS, highlighting key advancements,\ncomparative insights, and open challenges to guide future research.",

Remote sensing imagery exhibits substantial variability across\ntemporal, spectral, and spatial (TSS) dimensions, complicating unified data\nprocessing. Current deep learning models for dense prediction tasks, such as\nsemantic segmentation and change detection, are typically tailored to specific\ninput-output configurations.

Furthermore, a Local-Global\nWindow Attention mechanism is proposed to efficiently capture both local\ncontextual details and global dependencies, enhancing the model's adaptability\nand feature extraction capabilities.

Designed to operate effectively in noisy and dynamic marine\nenvironments, AquaSignal integrates state-of-the-art deep learning\narchitectures to enhance the reliability and accuracy of acoustic signal\nanalysis. The system is evaluated on a combined dataset from the Deepship and\nOcean Networks Canada (ONC) benchmarks, providing a diverse set of real-world\nunderwater scenarios. AquaSignal employs a U-Net architecture for denoising, a\nResNet18 convolutional neural network for classifying known acoustic events,\nand an AutoEncoder-based model for unsupervised detection of novel or anomalous\nsignals. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study to apply and\nevaluate this combination of techniques on maritime vessel acoustic data.\nExperimental results show that AquaSignal improves signal clarity and task\nperformance, achieving 71% classification accuracy and 91% accuracy in novelty\ndetection. Despite slightly lower classification performance compared to some\nstate-of-the-art models, differences in data partitioning strategies limit\ndirect comparisons. Overall, AquaSignal demonstrates strong potential for\nreal-time underwater acoustic monitoring in scientific, environmental, and\nmaritime domains.",

Machine learning (ML)-based models\nhave demonstrated significant advancements in simulation accuracy and\ncomputational efficiency compared to traditional numerical methods.\nNevertheless, a significant limitation of current ML models for S2S ocean\nsimulation is their inadequate incorporation of physical consistency and the\nslow-changing properties of the ocean system. In this work, we propose a neural\nocean model (NeuralOM) for S2S ocean simulation with a multi-scale interactive\ngraph neural network to emulate diverse physical phenomena associated with\nocean systems effectively. Specifically, we propose a multi-stage framework\ntailored to model the ocean's slowly changing nature. Additionally, we\nintroduce a multi-scale interactive messaging module to capture complex\ndynamical behaviors, such as gradient changes and multiplicative coupling\nrelationships inherent in ocean dynamics. Extensive experimental evaluations\nconfirm that our proposed NeuralOM outperforms state-of-the-art models in S2S\nand extreme event simulation.

Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) systems collect a large amount of\nunderwater sound recordings, but the large volume of data makes manual analysis\nimpossible, creating the need for automation. Although machine learning offers\na potential solution, most underwater acoustic recordings are unlabeled.\nSelf-supervised learning models have demonstrated success in learning from\nlarge-scale unlabeled data in various domains like computer vision, Natural\nLanguage Processing, and audio.

These parameterizations typically use a predetermined set of\nmodel parameters that are tuned to limited data from canonical flows. Using\nthese fixed parameters results in deterministic predictions that neglect\nuncertainty in the unresolved turbulence processes. In this study, we perform a\nmachine learning-accelerated Bayesian inversion of a single-column model of the\nABL. This approach is used to calibrate and quantify uncertainty in model\nparameters of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes turbulence models. Following\nverification of the uncertainty quantification methodology, we learn the\nparameters and their uncertainties in two different turbulence models\nconditioned on scale-resolving large-eddy simulation data over a range of ABL\nstabilities. We show how Bayesian inversion of a numerical model improves flow\npredictions by investigating the underlying mean momentum budgets. Further, we\nshow that uncertainty quantification based on neutral surface layer data\nrecovers the relationships between parameters derived from theoretical\nmodeling, but that learning the parameters based on stable ABL data or data\nfrom outside the surface layer can lead to different relationships than neutral\nsurface layer theory. Systematic uncertainty reduction methods reveal that (1)\nsampling wind speed up to the ABL height can reduce uncertainty in key model\nparameters by up to 84%, and (2) assimilating fluid flow quantities beyond\nfirst-order moment statistics can further reduce uncertainty in ways that wind\nspeed assimilation alone cannot achieve.

Applications include species distribution modelling and\nmineral prospectivity analysis. We clarify the interpretation of the ROC curve\nin this context. Contrary to statements in the literature, ROC does not measure\ngoodness-of-fit of a spatial model, and its interpretation as a measure of\npredictive ability is weak; it is a measure of ranking ability, insensitive to\nthe precise form of the model. To gain insight we draw connections between ROC\nand existing statistical techniques for spatial point pattern data. The area\nunder the ROC curve (AUC) is related to hypothesis tests of the null hypothesis\nthat the explanatory variables have no effect. The shape of the ROC curve has a\ndiagnostic interpretation. This suggests several new techniques, which extend\nthe scope of application of ROC curves for spatial data, to support variable\nselection and model selection, analysis of segregation between different types\nof points, adjustment for a baseline, and analysis of spatial case-control\ndata. The new techniques are illustrated with several real example datasets.\nOpen source R code implementing the techniques is available in the development\nversion of our package spatstat [Baddeley and Turner, 2005, Baddeley et al.,\n2015] and will be included in the next public release.",

Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) offers a\npromising alternative to mitigate this data dependency. However, existing SSS\nmethods often struggle with the inherent distribution mismatch between limited\nlabeled data and abundant unlabeled data, leading to suboptimal generalization.\nTo alleviate this issue, we attempt to introduce the Vision Foundation Models\n(VFMs) pre-trained on vast and diverse datasets into the SSS task since VFMs\npossess robust generalization capabilities that can effectively bridge this\ndistribution gap and provide strong semantic priors for SSS. Inspired by this,\nwe introduce RS-MTDF (Multi-Teacher Distillation and Fusion), a novel framework\nthat leverages the powerful semantic knowledge embedded in VFMs to guide\nsemi-supervised learning in remote sensing. Specifically, RS-MTDF employs\nmultiple frozen VFMs (e.g., DINOv2 and CLIP) as expert teachers, utilizing\nfeature-level distillation to align student features with their robust\nrepresentations. To further enhance discriminative power, the distilled\nknowledge is seamlessly fused into the student decoder. Extensive experiments\non three challenging remote sensing datasets demonstrate that RS-MTDF\nconsistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conventional methods\nface challenges due to sparse data, algorithmic complexity, and high\ncomputational costs, while increasing usage of machine learning (ML) method\nremains limited to reconstruction problems at the sea surface and local\nregions, struggling with issues like cloud occlusion. To address these\nlimitations, this paper proposes ReconMOST, a data-driven guided diffusion\nmodel framework for multi-layer sea temperature reconstruction. Specifically,\nwe first pre-train an unconditional diffusion model using a large collection of\nhistorical numerical simulation data, enabling the model to attain physically\nconsistent distribution patterns of ocean temperature fields. During the\ngeneration phase, sparse yet high-accuracy in-situ observational data are\nutilized as guidance points for the reverse diffusion process, generating\naccurate reconstruction results. Importantly, in regions lacking direct\nobservational data, the physically consistent spatial distribution patterns\nlearned during pre-training enable implicitly guided and physically plausible\nreconstructions. Our method extends ML-based SST reconstruction to a global,\nmulti-layer setting, handling over 92.5% missing data while maintaining\nreconstruction accuracy, spatial resolution, and superior generalization\ncapability. We pre-train our model on CMIP6 numerical simulation data and\nconduct guided reconstruction experiments on CMIP6 and EN4 analysis data.

However, achieving stable, long-range\nautoregressive forecasts beyond a few weeks remains a significant challenge.\nPrevailing state-of-the-art models that achieve year-long stability, such as\nSFNO and DLWP-HPX, have relied on transforming input data onto non-standard\nspatial domains like spherical harmonics or HEALPix meshes. This has led to the\nprevailing assumption that such representations are necessary to enforce\nphysical consistency and long-term stability. This paper challenges that\nassumption by investigating whether comparable long-range performance can be\nachieved on the standard latitude-longitude grid. We introduce AtmosMJ, a deep\nconvolutional network that operates directly on ERA5 data without any spherical\nremapping. The model's stability is enabled by a novel Gated Residual Fusion\n(GRF) mechanism, which adaptively moderates feature updates to prevent error\naccumulation over long recursive simulations. Our results demonstrate that\nAtmosMJ produces stable and physically plausible forecasts for about 500 days.\nIn quantitative evaluations, it achieves competitive 10-day forecast accuracy\nagainst models like Pangu-Weather and GraphCast, all while requiring a\nremarkably low training budget of 5.7 days on a V100 GPU. Our findings suggest\nthat efficient architectural design, rather than non-standard data\nrepresentation, can be the key to unlocking stable and computationally\nefficient long-range weather prediction.",

    "abstract": "Remote sensing change detection is essential for monitoring urban expansion,\ndisaster assessment, and resource management, offering timely, accurate, and\nlarge-scale insights into dynamic landscape transformations. While deep\nlearning has revolutionized change detection, the increasing complexity and\ncomputational demands of modern models have not necessarily translated into\nsignificant accuracy gains. Instead of following this trend, this study\nexplores a more efficient approach, focusing on lightweight models that\nmaintain high accuracy while minimizing resource consumption, which is an\nessential requirement for on-satellite processing. To this end, we propose\nFlickCD, which means quick flick then get great results, pushing the boundaries\nof the performance-resource trade-off.

This work\nintroduces Photon Absorption Remote Sensing (PARS), a new absorption microscope\nmodality, which simultaneously captures the dominant de-excitation processes\nfollowing an absorption event. In PARS, radiative (auto-fluorescence) and\nnon-radiative (photothermal and photoacoustic) relaxation processes are\ncollected simultaneously, providing enhanced specificity to a range of\nbiomolecules.

Gaussian\nmixture models (GMM) are used to characterize clinically relevant biomolecules\n(e.g., white, and gray matter) based on their PARS signals, while non-negative\nleast squares (NNLS) is applied to map the biomolecule abundance in murine\nbrain tissues, without stained ground truth images or deep-learning methods.\nPARS unmixing and abundance estimates are directly validated and compared\nagainst chemically stained ground truth images, and deep learning based-image\ntransforms.

Here, we present xarrayvideo, a Python library for\ncompressing multichannel spatiotemporal datasets by encoding them as videos.\nOur approach achieves compression ratios of up to 250x while maintaining high\nfidelity by leveraging standard, well-optimized video codecs through ffmpeg. We\ndemonstrate the library's effectiveness on four real-world multichannel\nspatiotemporal datasets: DynamicEarthNet (very high resolution Planet images),\nDeepExtremeCubes (high resolution Sentinel-2 images), ERA5 (weather reanalysis\ndata), and the SimpleS2 dataset (high resolution multichannel Sentinel-2\nimages), achieving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNRs) of 55.86, 40.60, 46.58,\nand 43.23 dB at 0.1 bits per pixel per band (bpppb) and 65.91, 54.28, 62.90,\nand 55.04 dB at 1 bpppb.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in deep learning for vision tasks have seen the rise of State\nSpace Models (SSMs) like Mamba, celebrated for their linear scalability.\nHowever, their adaptation to 2D visual data often necessitates complex\nmodifications that may diminish efficiency. In this paper, we introduce\nMambaOutRS, a novel hybrid convolutional architecture for remote sensing image\nclassification that re-evaluates the necessity of recurrent SSMs. MambaOutRS\nbuilds upon stacked Gated CNN blocks for local feature extraction and\nintroduces a novel Fourier Filter Gate (FFG) module that operates in the\nfrequency domain to capture global contextual information efficiently. Our\narchitecture employs a four-stage hierarchical design and was extensively\nevaluated on challenging remote sensing datasets: UC Merced, AID,\nNWPU-RESISC45, and EuroSAT. MambaOutRS consistently achieved state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) performance across these benchmarks. Notably, our MambaOutRS-t variant\n(24.0M parameters) attained the highest F1-scores of 98.41\\% on UC Merced and\n95.99\\% on AID, significantly outperforming existing baselines, including\nlarger transformer models and Mamba-based architectures, despite using\nconsiderably fewer parameters. An ablation study conclusively demonstrates the\ncritical role of the Fourier Filter Gate in enhancing the model's ability to\ncapture global spatial patterns, leading to robust and accurate classification.\nThese results strongly suggest that the complexities of recurrent SSMs can be\neffectively superseded by a judicious combination of gated convolutions for\nspatial mixing and frequency-based gates for spectral global context. Thus,\nMambaOutRS provides a compelling and efficient paradigm for developing\nhigh-performance deep learning models in remote sensing and other vision\ndomains, particularly where computational efficiency is paramount.",

This common approach struggles to model complex temporal\ndependencies and fails to explicitly account for the progressive growth of\nuncertainty inherent to such systems. While rolling diffusion frameworks, which\napply increasing noise to forecasts at longer lead times, have been proposed to\naddress this, their integration with state-of-the-art, high-fidelity diffusion\ntechniques remains a significant challenge.

To do this, we adapt the core EDM\ncomponents-its noise schedule, network preconditioning, and Heun sampler-to the\nrolling forecast setting. The success of this integration is driven by three\nkey contributions: (i) a novel loss weighting scheme that focuses model\ncapacity on the mid-range forecast horizons where determinism gives way to\nstochasticity; (ii) an efficient initialization strategy using a pre-trained\nEDM for the initial window; and (iii) a bespoke hybrid sequence architecture\nfor robust spatiotemporal feature extraction under progressive denoising.

We show that our\nFPGA-based model has detection and classification performance only ~2% and 3%\nlower than values from state-of-the-art GPU-based models, despite being two to\nthree orders of magnitude smaller in size. This work demonstrates small yet\nhighly performant ML models for time-critical SAR analysis, paving the way for\nmore autonomous, responsive, and scalable Earth observation systems.",

HRRRCast includes two architectures: a ResNet-based model (ResHRRR)\nand a Graph Neural Network-based model (GraphHRRR). ResHRRR uses convolutional\nneural networks enhanced with squeeze-and-excitation blocks and Feature-wise\nLinear Modulation, and supports probabilistic forecasting via the Denoising\nDiffusion Implicit Model (DDIM). To better handle longer lead times, we train a\nsingle model to predict multiple lead times (1h, 3h, and 6h), then use a greedy\nrollout strategy during inference. When evaluated on composite reflectivity\nover the full CONUS domain using ensembles of 3 to 10 members, ResHRRR\noutperforms HRRR forecast at light rainfall threshold (20 dBZ) and achieves\ncompetitive performance at moderate thresholds (30 dBZ). Our work advances the\nStormCast model of Pathak et al.

Grid-, neighborhood-, and\nobject-based metrics confirm better storm placement, lower frequency bias, and\nhigher success ratios than HRRR. HRRRCast ensemble forecasts also maintain\nsharper spatial detail, with power spectra more closely matching HRRR analysis.\nWhile GraphHRRR underperforms in its current form, it lays groundwork for\nfuture graph-based forecasting.

In practice, two-parameter spectra based on significant wave height and\nenergy period are ubiquitous. Two-parameter spectra have been shown\ninsufficient in capturing the range of spectral shapes that can occur in an\nactual ocean environment. Furthermore, through sensitivity analysis, these\ntwo-parameters have been shown to be insufficient for predicting power\nperformance of WECs. Four parameter spectra, which expand the parameter space\nto include two additional shape parameters have been shown sufficient in\ncapturing sea state variance, but their effect on mean power estimates has not\nbeen presented. This work directly looks at the effects of incorporating\n4-parameter spectra into annual power estimates compared to using the\ntraditional 2-parameter spectra. We use two different 4-parameter spectra: one\nfrom the literature and a novel machine learning-based autoencoder, presented\nhere. Both are shown to improve the information retained when parameterizing\nspectra. The site-specific autoencoder performs consistently the best across\ntwo case studies of mean annual power prediction, achieving an error around 1%\nin each instance. The 2-parameter spectra resulted in less consistent\npredictive performance, with errors of -8% and 1% in the two case studies. For\nthe case study where all three models performed well, it is shown that the low\nerror in the 2-parameter model is attributable to a symmetrical distribution of\nlarge errors whereas both 4-parameter spectra result in relatively low errors\nthroughout the parametric space. These results highlight the need for more\nsophisticated resource characterization methods for estimating the power\nperformance of WECs and suggest site-specific machine learning-based spectra\nare an adequate option.",

    "abstract": "Detecting tiny objects in remote sensing (RS) imagery has been a\nlong-standing challenge due to their extremely limited spatial information,\nweak feature representations, and dense distributions across complex\nbackgrounds. Despite numerous efforts devoted, mainstream detectors still\nunderperform in such scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce RS-TinyNet, a\nmulti-stage feature fusion and enhancement model explicitly tailored for RS\ntiny object detection in various RS scenarios. RS-TinyNet comes with two novel\ndesigns: tiny object saliency modeling and feature integrity reconstruction.\nGuided by these principles, we design three step-wise feature enhancement\nmodules. Among them, the multi-dimensional collaborative attention (MDCA)\nmodule employs multi-dimensional attention to enhance the saliency of tiny\nobjects. Additionally, the auxiliary reversible branch (ARB) and a progressive\nfusion detection head (PFDH) module are introduced to preserve information flow\nand fuse multi-level features to bridge semantic gaps and retain structural\ndetail. Comprehensive experiments on public RS dataset AI-TOD show that our\nRS-TinyNet surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors by 4.0% AP and\n6.5% AP75. Evaluations on DIOR benchmark dataset further validate its superior\ndetection performance in diverse RS scenarios. These results demonstrate that\nthe proposed multi-stage feature fusion strategy offers an effective and\npractical solution for tiny object detection in complex RS environments.",

This study presents the\nfirst comprehensive review of large-scale, pixel-wise crop mapping workflows,\nencompassing both conventional supervised methods and emerging transfer\nlearning approaches. To identify the optimal supervised crop mapping workflows,\nwe conducted systematic experiments, comparing six widely adopted satellite\nimage-based preprocessing methods, alongside eleven supervised pixel-wise\nclassification models. Additionally, we assessed the synergistic impact of\nvaried training sample sizes and variable combinations. Moreover, we identified\noptimal transfer learning techniques for different magnitudes of domain shift.\nThe evaluation of best methods was conducted across five diverse agricultural\nsites. Landsat 8 served as the primary satellite data source. Labels come from\nCDL trusted pixels and field surveys.\n  Our findings reveal three key insights. First, fine-scale interval\npreprocessing paired with Transformer models consistently delivered optimal\nperformance for both supervised and transferable workflows. RF offered rapid\ntraining and competitive performance in conventional supervised learning and\ndirect transfer to similar domains. Second, transfer learning techniques\nenhanced workflow adaptability, with UDA being effective for homogeneous crop\nclasses while fine-tuning remains robust across diverse scenarios. Finally,\nworkflow choice depends heavily on the availability of labeled samples. With a\nsufficient sample size, supervised training typically delivers more accurate\nand generalizable results. Below a certain threshold, transfer learning that\nmatches the level of domain shift is a viable alternative to achieve crop\nmapping.

To address these challenges, we develop DeepX-GAN\n(Dependence-Enhanced Embedding for Physical eXtremes - Generative Adversarial\nNetwork), a knowledge-informed deep generative model designed to better capture\nthe spatial structure of rare extremes. The zero-shot generalizability of\nDeepX-GAN enables simulation of unseen extremes that fall outside historical\nexperience yet remain statistically plausible.

These expanded labels are\nthen used to train ViT-based encoder-decoder models with multi-band inputs from\nSentinel-2 and Formosat-5 imagery. Our architecture supports multiple decoder\nvariants and multi-stage loss strategies to improve performance under limited\nsupervision. During the evaluation, model predictions are compared with\nhigher-resolution EVAP output to assess spatial coherence and segmentation\nconsistency. Case studies on the 2022 Poyang Lake drought and the 2023 Rhodes\nwildfire demonstrate that our framework improves the smoothness and reliability\nof segmentation results, offering a scalable approach for disaster mapping when\naccurate ground truth is unavailable.",

We propose an\nalternative view, where probabilities are treated as being about process\nprofiles, which better captures the dynamics of real world phenomena. Finally,\nwe demonstrate how our Markov chain based probability calculations can be\nseamlessly integrated back into the knowledge graph, enabling further analysis\nand decision-making.

We observe that\nfrequency-domain feature modeling particularly in the wavelet domain an amplify\nfine-grained differences in frequency components, enhancing the perception of\nedge changes that are challenging to capture in the spatial domain. Thus, we\npropose a method called Wavelet-Guided Dual-Frequency Encoding (WGDF).\nSpecifically, we first apply Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decompose the\ninput images into high-frequency and low-frequency components, which are used\nto model local details and global structures, respectively. In the\nhigh-frequency branch, we design a Dual-Frequency Feature Enhancement (DFFE)\nmodule to strengthen edge detail representation and introduce a\nFrequency-Domain Interactive Difference (FDID) module to enhance the modeling\nof fine-grained changes. In the low-frequency branch, we exploit Transformers\nto capture global semantic relationships and employ a Progressive Contextual\nDifference Module (PCDM) to progressively refine change regions, enabling\nprecise structural semantic characterization.

    "abstract": "Foundational models have achieved significant success in diverse domains of\ncomputer vision. They learn general representations that are easily\ntransferable to tasks not seen during training. One such foundational model is\nSegment anything model (SAM), which can accurately segment objects in images.\nWe propose adapting the SAM encoder via fine-tuning for remote sensing change\ndetection (RSCD) along with spatial-temporal feature enhancement (STFE) and\nmulti-scale decoder fusion (MSDF) to detect changes robustly at multiple\nscales. Additionally, we propose a novel cross-entropy masking (CEM) loss to\nhandle high class imbalance in change detection datasets.

    "abstract": "The proliferation of foundation models, pretrained on large-scale unlabeled\ndatasets, has emerged as an effective approach in creating adaptable and\nreusable architectures that can be leveraged for various downstream tasks using\nsatellite observations. However, their direct application to hyperspectral\nremote sensing remains challenging due to inherent spectral disparities and the\nscarcity of available observations. In this work, we present HyperKD, a novel\nknowledge distillation framework that enables transferring learned\nrepresentations from a teacher model into a student model for effective\ndevelopment of a foundation model on hyperspectral images. Unlike typical\nknowledge distillation frameworks, which use a complex teacher to guide a\nsimpler student, HyperKD enables an inverse form of knowledge transfer across\ndifferent types of spectral data, guided by a simpler teacher model. Building\nupon a Masked Autoencoder, HyperKD distills knowledge from the Prithvi\nfoundational model into a student tailored for EnMAP hyperspectral imagery.\nHyperKD addresses the inverse domain adaptation problem with spectral gaps by\nintroducing a feature-based strategy that includes spectral range-based channel\nalignment, spatial feature-guided masking, and an enhanced loss function\ntailored for hyperspectral images. HyperKD bridges the substantial spectral\ndomain gap, enabling the effective use of pretrained foundation models for\ngeospatial applications. Extensive experiments show that HyperKD significantly\nimproves representation learning in MAEs, leading to enhanced reconstruction\nfidelity and more robust performance on downstream tasks such as land cover\nclassification, crop type identification, and soil organic carbon prediction,\nunderpinning the potential of knowledge distillation frameworks in remote\nsensing analytics with hyperspectral imagery.",

For each subregion, we compute Betti0, Betti1, and their\nratio using a recent algorithm for homology groups in 2D digital images. The\nresulting invariants form a feature matrix used with logistic regression, KNN,\nand SVM (with PCA and 100 randomized repetitions).

The\ntopological features showed high accuracy with low variance.\n  Conclusion - This is the first use of topological invariants from formal\ndigital homology for iris recognition. The method offers a compact,\ninterpretable, and accurate alternative to deep learning, useful when\nexplainability or limited data is important.

    "abstract": "Reliable long-lead forecasting of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)\nremains a long-standing challenge in climate science. The previously developed\nMultimodal ENSO Forecast (MEF) model uses 80 ensemble predictions by two\nindependent deep learning modules: a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN)\nand a time-series module. In their approach, outputs of the two modules are\ncombined using a weighting strategy wherein one is prioritized over the other\nas a function of global performance. Separate weighting or testing of\nindividual ensemble members did not occur, however, which may have limited the\nmodel to optimize the use of high-performing but spread-out forecasts. In this\nstudy, we propose a better framework that employs graph-based analysis to\ndirectly model similarity between all 80 members of the ensemble. By\nconstructing an undirected graph whose vertices are ensemble outputs and whose\nweights on edges measure similarity (via RMSE and correlation), we identify and\ncluster structurally similar and accurate predictions. From which we obtain an\noptimized subset of 20 members using community detection methods. The final\nprediction is then obtained by averaging this optimized subset. This method\nimproves the forecast skill through noise removal and emphasis on ensemble\ncoherence. Interestingly, our graph-based selection shows robust statistical\ncharacteristics among top performers, offering new ensemble behavior insights.\nIn addition, we observe that while the GNN-based approach does not always\noutperform the baseline MEF under every scenario, it produces more stable and\nconsistent outputs, particularly in compound long-lead situations.

However, separating these modes of variability remains\nchallenging due to their spatial overlap and possible nonlinear coupling, which\nviolates the assumptions of traditional linear methods. We develop a\nKnowledge-Guided AutoEncoder (KGAE) that uses spectral constraints to identify\nphysically interpretable modes, without the need for predefined temporal\nfilters or thresholds. The KGAE separates ENSO-like modes on 2- and 3-7-year\ntimescales and a decadal mode with characteristics reminiscent of the PDO and\nthe NPMM, each with distinct spatial patterns. We demonstrate that the decadal\nmode modulates ENSO diversity (central Pacific versus eastern Pacific), and\nthat a quasibiennial mode leads and follows the interannual mode, suggesting a\nrole in ENSO onset and decay. When applied to climate model output, KGAEs\nreveal model-specific biases in ENSO diversity and seasonal timing. Finally,\nresidual training isolates a primarily equatorial decadal mode, which may be a\ncomponent of TPDV-related decadal variability, likely originating from\nadvection linked to upwelling near the Gal\\'apagos Islands and the South\nEquatorial Current.

The emergence of these methods prompts a revisit to the impact of data\npreprocessing, a topic familiar to the climate community, as more traditional\nstatistical models work with relatively small sample sizes. Indeed, the skill\nand confidence in the forecasts produced by data-driven models are directly\ninfluenced by the quality of the datasets and how they are treated during model\ndevelopment, thus yielding the colloquialism \"garbage in, garbage out.\" As\nsuch, this article establishes protocols for the proper preprocessing of input\ndata for AI/ML models designed for climate prediction (i.e., subseasonal to\ndecadal and longer). The three aims are to: (1) educate researchers,\ndevelopers, and end users on the effects that preprocessing has on climate\npredictions; (2) provide recommended practices for data preprocessing for such\napplications; and (3) empower end users to decipher whether the models they are\nusing are properly designed for their objectives. Specific topics covered in\nthis article include the creation of (standardized) anomalies, dealing with\nnon-stationarity and the spatiotemporally correlated nature of climate data,\nand handling of extreme values and variables with potentially complex\ndistributions. Case studies will illustrate how using different preprocessing\ntechniques can produce different predictions from the same model, which can\ncreate confusion and decrease confidence in the overall process.

Driven solely by atmospheric forcings, we attribute GenSIM's\nemergent extrapolation capabilities to patterns that reflect the long-term\nimpact of the ocean: it seemingly has learned an internal ocean emulator. This\nability to infer slowly evolving climate-relevant dynamics from short-term\npredictions underlines the large potential of generative models to generalise\nfor unseen climates and to encode hidden physics.",

Although open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS)\noffers a promising solution, existing frameworks designed for natural images\nare insufficient for the unique complexities of RS data. They struggle with\nvast scale variations and fine-grained details, and their adaptation often\nrelies on extensive, costly annotations. To address this critical gap, this\npaper introduces SegEarth-OV, the first framework for annotation-free\nopen-vocabulary segmentation of RS images.

Furthermore, to extend the\nframework's universality to other challenging RS modalities like SAR images,\nwhere large-scale VLMs are unavailable and expensive to create, we introduce\nAlignEarth, which is a distillation-based strategy and can efficiently transfer\nsemantic knowledge from an optical VLM encoder to an SAR encoder, bypassing the\nneed to build SAR foundation models from scratch and enabling universal OVSS\nacross diverse sensor types.

    "abstract": "Worldwide geo-localization involves determining the exact geographic location\nof images captured globally, typically guided by geographic cues such as\nclimate, landmarks, and architectural styles. Despite advancements in\ngeo-localization models like GeoCLIP, which leverages images and location\nalignment via contrastive learning for accurate predictions, the\ninterpretability of these models remains insufficiently explored. Current\nconcept-based interpretability methods fail to align effectively with\nGeo-alignment image-location embedding objectives, resulting in suboptimal\ninterpretability and performance. To address this gap, we propose a novel\nframework integrating global geo-localization with concept bottlenecks. Our\nmethod inserts a Concept-Aware Alignment Module that jointly projects image and\nlocation embeddings onto a shared bank of geographic concepts (e.g., tropical\nclimate, mountain, cathedral) and minimizes a concept-level loss, enhancing\nalignment in a concept-specific subspace and enabling robust interpretability.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce interpretability into\ngeo-localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses\nGeoCLIP in geo-localization accuracy and boosts performance across diverse\ngeospatial prediction tasks, revealing richer semantic insights into geographic\ndecision-making processes.",

Subsequently, boundary\nenhancement convolution is applied to amplify these difference features. In the\nCoarse Change Moment Extraction, the enhanced difference features from the\nfirst step are used to spatiotemporal correlation analysis, and then two\ndistinct methods are employed to determine coarse change moments. In the Fine\nChange Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference, a multiscale temporal Class\nActivation Mapping (CAM) module first increases the weight of the\nchange-occurring moment from coarse change moments.

Geostatistics leverages\nthe spatial structure of soil properties, while machine learning captures the\nrelationship between available environmental features and soil properties. We\npropose a hybrid framework that enriches ML with spatial context through\nengineering of 'spatial lag' features from ordinary kriging. We call this\napproach 'kriging prior regression' (KpR), as it follows the inverse logic of\nregression kriging. To evaluate this approach, we assessed both the point and\nprobabilistic prediction performance of KpR, using the TabPFN model across six\nfieldscale datasets from LimeSoDa. These datasets included soil organic carbon,\nclay content, and pH, along with features derived from remote sensing and\nin-situ proximal soil sensing. KpR with TabPFN demonstrated reliable\nuncertainty estimates and more accurate predictions in comparison to several\nother spatial techniques (e.g., regression/residual kriging with TabPFN), as\nwell as to established non-spatial machine learning algorithms (e.g., random\nforest). Most notably, it significantly improved the average R2 by around 30%\ncompared to machine learning algorithms without spatial context. This\nimprovement was due to the strong prediction performance of the TabPFN\nalgorithm itself and the complementary spatial information provided by KpR\nfeatures. TabPFN is particularly effective for prediction tasks with small\nsample sizes, common in precision agriculture, whereas KpR can compensate for\nweak relationships between sensing features and soil properties when proximal\nsoil sensing data are limited.

    "abstract": "Machine-learnt weather prediction (MLWP) models are now well established as\nbeing competitive with conventional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models\nin the medium range. However, there is still much uncertainty as to how this\nperformance extends to longer timescales, where interactions with slower\ncomponents of the earth system become important. We take GenCast, a\nstate-of-the-art probabilistic MLWP model, and apply it to the task of seasonal\nforecasting with prescribed sea surface temperature (SST), by providing\nanomalies persisted over climatology (GenCast-Persisted) or forcing with\nobservations (GenCast-Forced). The forecasts are compared to the European\nCentre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts seasonal forecasting system, SEAS5.\nOur results indicate that, despite being trained at short timescales,\nGenCast-Persisted produces much of the correct precipitation patterns in\nresponse to El Ni\\~{n}o and La Ni\\~{n}a events, with several erroneous patterns\nin GenCast-Persisted corrected with GenCast-Forced. The uncertainty in\nprecipitation response, as represented by the ensemble, compares favourably to\nSEAS5. Whilst SEAS5 achieves superior skill in the tropics for 2-metre\ntemperature and mean sea level pressure (MSLP), GenCast-Persisted achieves\nsignificantly higher skill in some areas in higher latitudes, including\nmountainous areas, with notable improvements for MSLP in particular; this is\nreflected in a higher correlation with the observed NAO index. Reliability\ndiagrams indicate that GenCast-Persisted is overconfident compared to SEAS5,\nwhilst GenCast-Forced produces well-calibrated seasonal 2-metre temperature\npredictions. These results provide an indication of the potential of MLWP\nmodels similar to GenCast for the `full' seasonal forecasting problem, where\nthe atmospheric model is coupled to ocean, land and cryosphere models.",

    "abstract": "Sustainable management of marine ecosystems is vital for maintaining healthy\nfishery resources, and benefits from advanced scientific tools to accurately\nassess species distribution patterns. In fisheries science, two primary data\nsources are used: fishery-independent data (FID), collected through systematic\nsurveys, and fishery-dependent data (FDD), obtained from commercial fishing\nactivities. While these sources provide complementary information, their\ndistinct sampling schemes - systematic for FID and preferential for FDD - pose\nsignificant integration challenges. This study introduces a novel\nspatio-temporal model that integrates FID and FDD, addressing challenges\nassociated with zero-inflation and preferential sampling (PS) common in\necological data. The model employs a six-layer structure to differentiate\nbetween presence-absence and biomass observations, offering a robust framework\nfor ecological studies affected by PS biases. Simulation results demonstrate\nthe model's accuracy in parameter estimation across diverse PS scenarios and\nits ability to detect preferential signals. Application to the study of the\ndistribution patterns of the European sardine populations along the southern\nPortuguese continental shelf illustrates the model's effectiveness in\nintegrating diverse data sources and incorporating environmental and\nvessel-specific covariates. The model reveals spatio-temporal variability in\nsardine presence and biomass, providing actionable insights for fisheries\nmanagement.

These issues restrict their practical applicability\nin RS. To address this limitation, we propose an adaptation for enhancing the\nefficiency of RS FMs by integrating the Soft mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism\ninto the FM. The integration of Soft MoEs into the FM allows modality-specific\nexpert specialization alongside shared cross-sensor representation learning.

Due to the high dimensionality of HSI data and the\nslow rate of data transfer in satellite-based systems, compact and efficient\nmodels are required to support onboard processing and minimize the transmission\nof redundant or low-value data, e.g. cloud-covered areas. To this end, we\nintroduce a novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning (CMTSSL)\nframework designed for lightweight architectures for HSI analysis. CMTSSL\nintegrates masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw\npuzzle solving, guided by a curriculum learning strategy that progressively\nincreases data complexity during self-supervision. This enables the encoder to\njointly capture fine-grained spectral continuity, spatial structure, and global\nsemantic features. Unlike prior dual-task SSL methods, CMTSSL simultaneously\naddresses spatial and spectral reasoning within a unified and computationally\nefficient design, being particularly suitable for training lightweight models\nfor onboard satellite deployment. We validate our approach on four public\nbenchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent gains in downstream segmentation\ntasks, using architectures that are over 16,000x lighter than some\nstate-of-the-art models.

Traditional vessel detection\nmethods, such as synthetic aperture radar, video surveillance, and\nmultispectral satellite imagery, face limitations in real-time processing,\nadverse weather conditions, and coverage range. This paper explores Distributed\nAcoustic Sensing (DAS) as an alternative by repurposing submarine\ntelecommunication cables as large-scale acoustic sensor arrays. DAS offers\ncontinuous real-time monitoring, operates independently of cooperative systems\nlike the \"Automatic Identification System\" (AIS), being largely unaffected by\nlighting or weather conditions. However, existing research on DAS for vessel\ntracking is limited in scale and lacks validation under real-world conditions.\nTo address these gaps, a general and systematic methodology is presented for\nvessel detection and distance estimation using DAS. Advanced machine learning\nmodels are applied to improve detection and localization accuracy in dynamic\nmaritime environments. The approach is evaluated over a continuous ten-day\nperiod, covering diverse ship and operational conditions, representing one of\nthe largest-scale DAS-based vessel monitoring studies to date, and for which we\nrelease the full evaluation dataset.

ViTP embeds a Vision Transformer (ViT)\nbackbone within a Vision-Language Model and pretrains it end-to-end using a\nrich corpus of visual instruction data curated from target downstream domains.\nViTP is powered by our proposed Visual Robustness Learning (VRL), which compels\nthe ViT to learn robust and domain-relevant features from a sparse set of\nvisual tokens. Extensive experiments on 16 challenging remote sensing and\nmedical imaging benchmarks demonstrate that ViTP establishes new\nstate-of-the-art performance across a diverse range of downstream tasks.

However, this\ntask is often challenged by the high spatial resolution, complex scene\nstructures, and diverse object scales present in remote sensing data. To\naddress these challenges, various deep learning architectures have been\nproposed, including convolutional neural networks, Vision Transformers, and the\nrecently introduced Vision Mamba. Vision Mamba features a global receptive\nfield and low computational complexity, demonstrating both efficiency and\neffectiveness in image segmentation. However, its reliance on global scanning\ntends to overlook critical local features, such as textures and edges, which\nare essential for achieving accurate segmentation in remote sensing contexts.\nTo tackle this limitation, we propose SwinMamba, a novel framework inspired by\nthe Swin Transformer. SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning\nwithin shifted windows with a global receptive field, to enhance the model's\nperception of both local and global features. Specifically, the first two\nstages of SwinMamba perform local scanning to capture fine-grained details,\nwhile its subsequent two stages leverage global scanning to fuse broader\ncontextual information. In our model, the use of overlapping shifted windows\nenhances inter-region information exchange, facilitating more robust feature\nintegration across the entire image.

This allows for more accurate identification,\nand their public availability from missions, such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat,\nonly adds to their value. Currently, the automatic analysis of such data is\npredominantly managed through machine learning models specifically trained for\nmulti-spectral input, which are costly to train and support. Furthermore,\nalthough providing a lot of utility for Remote Sensing, such additional inputs\ncannot be used with powerful generalist large multimodal models, which are\ncapable of solving many visual problems, but are not able to understand\nspecialized multi-spectral signals.\n  To address this, we propose a training-free approach which introduces new\nmulti-spectral data in a Zero-Shot-only mode, as inputs to generalist\nmultimodal models, trained on RGB-only inputs. Our approach leverages the\nmultimodal models' understanding of the visual space, and proposes to adapt to\ninputs to that space, and to inject domain-specific information as instructions\ninto the model.

Early detection can help improve the survival rate through\ntimely intervention and treatment. Traditional methods of detecting cancer\ninvolve manually examining mammograms, CT scans, ultrasounds, and other imaging\ntypes. However, this makes the process labor-intensive and requires the\nexpertise of trained pathologists. Hence, making it both time-consuming and\nresource-intensive. In this paper, we introduce a novel vision transformer\n(ViT)-based method for detecting and classifying breast and ovarian cancer.

Further, we use a preprocessing pipeline that\nconverts raw histophological images into standardized PyTorch tensors, which\nare compatible with the ViT architecture and also help improve the model\nperformance. We evaluated the performance of our model on two benchmark\ndatasets: the BreakHis dataset for binary classification and the UBC-OCEAN\ndataset for five-class classification without any data augmentation. Our model\nsurpasses existing CNN, ViT, and topological data analysis-based approaches in\nbinary classification.

To this\nend, this study presents GeoLink, a multimodal framework that leverages OSM\ndata to enhance RS FM during both the pretraining and downstream task stages.\nSpecifically, GeoLink enhances RS self-supervised pretraining using\nmulti-granularity learning signals derived from OSM data, guided by cross-modal\nspatial correlations for information interaction and collaboration. It also\nintroduces image mask-reconstruction to enable sparse input for efficient\npretraining. For downstream tasks, GeoLink generates both unimodal and\nmultimodal fine-grained encodings to support a wide range of applications, from\ncommon RS interpretation tasks like land cover classification to more\ncomprehensive geographic tasks like urban function zone mapping. Extensive\nexperiments show that incorporating OSM data during pretraining enhances the\nperformance of the RS image encoder, while fusing RS and OSM data in downstream\ntasks improves the FM's adaptability to complex geographic scenarios.

In this work, we propose a novel diffusion\nmodel conditioned on environmental context, that is able to generate satellite\nimages by conditioning from any combination of three different control signals:\na) text, b) metadata, and c) visual data. In contrast to previous works, the\nproposed method is i) to our knowledge, the first of its kind to condition\nsatellite image generation on dynamic environmental conditions as part of its\ncontrol signals, and ii) incorporating a metadata fusion strategy that models\nattribute embedding interactions to account for partially corrupt and/or\nmissing observations. Our method outperforms previous methods both\nqualitatively (robustness to missing metadata, higher responsiveness to control\ninputs) and quantitatively (higher fidelity, accuracy, and quality of\ngenerations measured using 6 different metrics) in the trials of single-image\nand temporal generation. The reported results support our hypothesis that\nconditioning on environmental context can improve the performance of foundation\nmodels for satellite imagery, and render our model a promising candidate for\nusage in downstream tasks.

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based techniques for the analysis of multimodal remote sensing\ndata have become popular due to their ability to effectively integrate\ncomplementary spatial, spectral, and structural information from different\nsensors. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have\nattracted attention in the remote sensing community due to their powerful\nability to capture robust and complex spatial-spectral distributions. However,\npre-training multimodal DDPMs may result in modality imbalance, and effectively\nleveraging diffusion features to guide complementary diversity feature\nextraction remains an open question. To address these issues, this paper\nproposes a balanced diffusion-guided fusion (BDGF) framework that leverages\nmultimodal diffusion features to guide a multi-branch network for land-cover\nclassification. Specifically, we propose an adaptive modality masking strategy\nto encourage the DDPMs to obtain a modality-balanced rather than spectral\nimage-dominated data distribution. Subsequently, these diffusion features\nhierarchically guide feature extraction among CNN, Mamba, and transformer\nnetworks by integrating feature fusion, group channel attention, and\ncross-attention mechanisms. Finally, a mutual learning strategy is developed to\nenhance inter-branch collaboration by aligning the probability entropy and\nfeature similarity of individual subnetworks. Extensive experiments on four\nmultimodal remote sensing datasets demonstrate that the proposed method\nachieves superior classification performance.

Regional climate models (RCMs)\nprovide this refinement, but are computationally expensive. To address this\nissue, machine learning models can learn the downscaling function, mapping\ncoarse GCM outputs to high-resolution fields. Among these, generative\napproaches aim to capture the full conditional distribution of RCM data given\ncoarse-scale GCM data, which is characterized by large variability and thus\nchallenging to model accurately. We introduce EnScale, a generative machine\nlearning framework that emulates the full GCM-to-RCM map by training on\nmultiple pairs of GCM and corresponding RCM data. It first adjusts large-scale\nmismatches between GCM and coarsened RCM data, followed by a super-resolution\nstep to generate high-resolution fields. Both steps employ generative models\noptimized with the energy score, a proper scoring rule. Compared to\nstate-of-the-art ML downscaling approaches, our setup reduces computational\ncost by about one order of magnitude. EnScale jointly emulates multiple\nvariables -- temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, and wind -- spatially\nconsistent over an area in Central Europe.

However, these techniques often struggle to extract\nstructural and detail features from heterogeneous and redundant multimodal\nimages. With the goal of introducing frequency domain learning to model key and\nsparse detail features, this paper introduces the spatial-spectral-frequency\ninteraction network (S$^2$Fin), which integrates pairwise fusion modules across\nthe spatial, spectral, and frequency domains. Specifically, we propose a\nhigh-frequency sparse enhancement transformer that employs sparse\nspatial-spectral attention to optimize the parameters of the high-frequency\nfilter. Subsequently, a two-level spatial-frequency fusion strategy is\nintroduced, comprising an adaptive frequency channel module that fuses\nlow-frequency structures with enhanced high-frequency details, and a\nhigh-frequency resonance mask that emphasizes sharp edges via phase similarity.\nIn addition, a spatial-spectral attention fusion module further enhances\nfeature extraction at intermediate layers of the network. Experiments on four\nbenchmark multimodal datasets with limited labeled data demonstrate that\nS$^2$Fin performs superior classification, outperforming state-of-the-art\nmethods.

In\nthis context, weak labels can be gathered in large quantities by leveraging on\nexisting low-resolution or obsolete products. In this paper, we address the\nproblem of training land-cover classifiers using high-resolution imagery (e.g.,\nSentinel-2) and weak low-resolution reference data (e.g., MODIS -derived\nland-cover maps). Inspired by recent works in Deep Multiple Instance Learning\n(DMIL), we propose a method that trains pixel-level multi-class classifiers and\npredicts low-resolution labels (i.e., patch-level classification), where the\nactual high-resolution labels are learned implicitly without direct\nsupervision. This is achieved with flexible pooling layers that are able to\nlink the semantics of the pixels in the high-resolution imagery to the\nlow-resolution reference labels. Then, the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)\nproblem is re-framed in a multi-class and in a multi-label setting. In the\nformer, the low-resolution annotation represents the majority of the pixels in\nthe patch. In the latter, the annotation only provides us information on the\npresence of one of the land-cover classes in the patch and thus multiple labels\ncan be considered valid for a patch at a time, whereas the low-resolution\nlabels provide us only one label. Therefore, the classifier is trained with a\nPositive-Unlabeled Learning (PUL) strategy. Experimental results on the 2020\nIEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed\nframework compared to standard training strategies.",

However, most\nML-based forecast models treat reanalysis as the truth and are trained under\nvariable-specific loss weighting, ignoring their physical coupling and spatial\nstructure. Over long time horizons, the forecasts become blurry and physically\nunrealistic under rollout training. To address this, we reinterpret model\ntraining as a weak-constraint four-dimensional variational data assimilation\n(WC-4DVar) problem, treating reanalysis data as imperfect observations. This\nallows the loss function to incorporate reanalysis error covariance and capture\nmultivariate dependencies. In practice, we compute the loss in a latent space\nlearned by an autoencoder (AE), where the reanalysis error covariance becomes\napproximately diagonal, thus avoiding the need to explicitly model it in the\nhigh-dimensional model space. We show that rollout training with latent-space\nconstraints improves long-term forecast skill and better preserves fine-scale\nstructures and physical realism compared to training with model-space loss.\nFinally, we extend this framework to accommodate heterogeneous data sources,\nenabling the forecast model to be trained jointly on reanalysis and\nmulti-source observations within a unified theoretical formulation.",

This can hamper specific user\ngoals, such as monitoring illegal fishing, by producing irrelevant detections.\nTo address this, we propose a cascaded approach that couples the broad\ngeneralization of a large pre-trained OVD model with a lightweight few-shot\nclassifier. Our method first employs the zero-shot model to generate\nhigh-recall object proposals. These proposals are then refined for high\nprecision by a compact classifier trained in real-time on only a handful of\nuser-annotated examples - drastically reducing the high costs of RS imagery\nannotation.The core of our framework is FLAME, a one-step active learning\nstrategy that selects the most informative samples for training. FLAME\nidentifies, on the fly, uncertain marginal candidates near the decision\nboundary using density estimation, followed by clustering to ensure sample\ndiversity. This efficient sampling technique achieves high accuracy without\ncostly full-model fine-tuning and enables instant adaptation, within less then\na minute, which is significantly faster than state-of-the-art alternatives.Our\nmethod consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance on RS benchmarks,\nestablishing a practical and resource-efficient framework for adapting\nfoundation models to specific user needs.",

This\nstudy proposes Hurdle-Inversion Model Debiasing Learning (IMDL) framework.\nFollowing a divide-and-conquer strategy, imbalance in the rain distribution is\ndecomposed into two components: zero inflation, defined by the predominance of\nnon-rain samples; and long tail, defined by the disproportionate abundance of\nlight-rain samples relative to heavy-rain samples.

The architecture employs a patch-based Swin\nTransformer backbone with periodic convolutions to handle longitudinal\ncontinuity and integrates time and noise embeddings through conditional layer\nnormalization. A dual-branch decoder predicts total precipitation and other\nvariables, with targeted freezing of encoder-decoder pathways for specialized\ntraining. Training minimizes a hybrid loss combining the Continuous Ranked\nProbability Score (CRPS) and weighted log1p mean squared error (log1pMSE),\nbalancing probabilistic accuracy and magnitude fidelity. During inference, the\nmodel ingests real-time Global Forecast System (GFS) initial conditions to\ngenerate 15-day forecasts autoregressively. Evaluation against GEFS using IMERG\ndata demonstrates higher Critical Success Index (CSI) scores at precipitation\nthresholds of 0.1 mm, 1 mm, 10 mm, and 20 mm, highlighting improved performance\nfor moderate to heavy rainfall.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between different components of the Earth System (e.g. ocean,\natmosphere, land and cryosphere) are a crucial driver of global weather\npatterns. Modern Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems typically run\nseparate models of the different components, explicitly coupled across their\ninterfaces to additionally model exchanges between the different components.\nAccurately representing these coupled interactions remains a major scientific\nand technical challenge of weather forecasting. GraphDOP is a graph-based\nmachine learning model that learns to forecast weather directly from raw\nsatellite and in-situ observations, without reliance on reanalysis products or\ntraditional physics-based NWP models. GraphDOP simultaneously embeds\ninformation from diverse observation sources spanning the full Earth system\ninto a shared latent space. This enables predictions that implicitly capture\ncross-domain interactions in a single model without the need for any explicit\ncoupling. Here we present a selection of case studies which illustrate the\ncapability of GraphDOP to forecast events where coupled processes play a\nparticularly key role. These include rapid sea-ice freezing in the Arctic,\nmixing-induced ocean surface cooling during Hurricane Ian and the severe\nEuropean heat wave of 2022. The results suggest that learning directly from\nEarth System observations can successfully characterise and propagate\ncross-component interactions, offering a promising path towards physically\nconsistent end-to-end data-driven Earth System prediction with a single model.",

However, due to sensor-specific\ncharacteristics and varying imaging conditions, these models suffer from\nsubstantial performance degradation when applied to unseen satellite data,\nlacking generalizability and thus limiting their applicability. We argue that\nthe performance drops stem primarily from distributional discrepancies from\ndifferent sources and the key to addressing this challenge lies in bridging the\ngap between training and testing distributions. To validate the idea and\nfurther achieve a \"train once, deploy forever\" capability, this paper\nintroduces a novel and intuitive approach to enpower any pansharpening models\nwith generalizability by employing a unified distribution strategy (UniPAN).\nSpecifically, we construct a distribution transformation function that\nnormalizes the pixels sampled from different sources to conform to an identical\ndistribution. The deep models are trained on the transformed domain, and during\ntesting on new datasets, the new data are also transformed to match the\ntraining distribution. UniPAN aims to train and test the model on a unified and\nconsistent distribution, thereby enhancing its generalizability. Extensive\nexperiments validate the efficacy of UniPAN, demonstrating its potential to\nsignificantly enhance the performance of deep pansharpening models across\ndiverse satellite sensors.

As high-resolution spatial data becomes\nincreasingly available through remote sensing and automated image analysis,\nidentifying spatial covariates that influence the localization of events is\ncrucial to understand the underlying mechanism. However, results from automated\nacquisition techniques are often noisy, for example due to measurement\nuncertainties or detection errors, which leads to spurious displacements and\nmissed events. We study the impact of such noise on sparse point-process\nestimation across different models, including Poisson and Thomas processes. To\nimprove noise robustness, we propose to use stability selection based on\npoint-process subsampling and to incorporate a non-convex best-subset penalty\nto enhance model-selection performance. In extensive simulations, we\ndemonstrate that such an approach reliably recovers true covariates under\ndiverse noise scenarios and improves both selection accuracy and stability. We\nthen apply the proposed method to a forestry data set, analyzing the\ndistribution of trees in relation to elevation and soil nutrients in a tropical\nrain forest. This shows the practical utility of the method, which provides a\nsystematic framework for robust variable selection in spatial point-process\nmodels under noise, without requiring additional knowledge of the process.",

Such models rely\non key assumptions about the underlying process in order to enable faithful\nlearning of governing dynamics that mimic the actual system behavior. The de\nfacto assumption in current approaches relies on the principle of least action\nthat results in gradient field dynamics and leads to trajectories minimizing an\nenergy functional between two probability measures. However, many real-world\nsystems, such as cell cycles in single-cell RNA, are known to exhibit\nnon-gradient, periodic behavior, which fundamentally cannot be captured by\ncurrent state-of-the-art methods such as flow and bridge matching. In this\npaper, we introduce Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM), a novel approach that is\ncapable of learning non-gradient field dynamics by designing and solving a\nSchr\\\"odinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process -- in\nstark contrast to typical zero-drift reference processes -- which is\nconstructed using inferred velocities in addition to population snapshot data.\nWe showcase Curly-FM by solving the trajectory inference problems for single\ncells, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean currents with approximate\nvelocities. We demonstrate that Curly-FM can learn trajectories that better\nmatch both the reference process and population marginals. Curly-FM expands\nflow matching models beyond the modeling of populations and towards the\nmodeling of known periodic behavior in physical systems.

    "abstract": "Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) enables versatile, all-time, all-weather\nremote sensing. Coupled with automatic target recognition (ATR) leveraging\nmachine learning (ML), SAR is empowering a wide range of Earth observation and\nsurveillance applications. However, the surge of attacks based on adversarial\nperturbations against the ML algorithms underpinning SAR ATR is prompting the\nneed for systematic research into adversarial perturbation mechanisms. Research\nin this area began in the digital (image) domain and evolved into the physical\n(signal) domain, resulting in physical adversarial attacks (PAAs) that\nstrategically exploit corner reflectors as attack vectors to evade ML-based\nATR. This paper proposes a novel framework called SAR Aspect-Angles-Invariant\nPhysical Adversarial Attack (SAAIPAA) for physics-based modelling of\nreflector-actuated adversarial perturbations, which improves on the rigor of\nprior work. A unique feature of SAAIPAA is its ability to remain effective even\nwhen the attacker lacks knowledge of the SAR platform's aspect angles, by\ndeploying at least one reflector in each azimuthal quadrant and optimizing\nreflector orientations. The resultant physical evasion attacks are efficiently\nrealizable and optimal over the considered range of aspect angles between a SAR\nplatform and a target, achieving state-of-the-art fooling rates (over 80% for\nDenseNet-121 and ResNet50) in the white-box setting. When aspect angles are\nknown to the attacker, an average fooling rate of 99.2% is attainable. In\nblack-box settings, although the attack efficacy of SAAIPAA transfers well\nbetween some models (e.g., from ResNet50 to DenseNet121), the transferability\nto some models (e.g., MobileNetV2) can be improved. A useful outcome of using\nthe MSTAR dataset for the experiments in this article, a method for generating\nbounding boxes for densely sampled azimuthal SAR datasets is introduced.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental challenge in ocean dynamics is the disentanglement of balanced\nmotions and internal waves. Extracting internal tidal (IT) imprints on surface\ndata is a central part of this challenge. For IT extraction, traditional\nharmonic analysis fails in the presence of strong incoherence and poor temporal\nsampling, as is common in global satellite observations. The advent of new\nwide-swath satellites, which provide two-dimensional spatial coverage, allows\nIT extraction to be reformulated as an image translation problem. Building on\nrecent work where we developed a deep learning approach to extract IT\nsignatures from sea surface height (SSH) in an idealized turbulent simulation,\nwe show here that a simpler and computationally cheaper algorithm can perform\nequally well if the learning rate is annealed during training. Using this new,\nconvenient algorithm, we experiment with different combinations of input\nsurface fields -- SSH, surface temperature, and surface velocity. All fields\ncontribute synergistically to disentanglement, with surface velocity by far the\nmost informative. These findings underscore the value of coordinated\nmulti-platform observational campaigns and highlight the critical importance of\nsurface velocity observations for separating balanced motions and internal\nwaves. Additional insights into the behavior of deep learning algorithm emerge:\nboth wave signature and scattering medium aids IT extraction, and to exploit\nlarge-scale information in the scattering medium, the algorithm must be highly\nnon-local. Residual errors of our algorithm concentrate at small spatial scales\nnear mode-2 tidal wavelengths, likely arising from artifacts introduced during\ndata preparation (e.g., Doppler shifts) as well as imperfections in the deep\nlearning architecture.",

Major space weather contributors are the solar wind and coronal mass ejections whose variable density, speed, temperature, and magnetic field make the automated classification of those structures challenging. In this work, we adapt a foundation model for solar physics, originally trained on Solar Dynamics Observatory imagery, to create embeddings suitable for solar wind structure analysis. These embeddings are concatenated with the spacecraft position and solar magnetic connectivity encoded using Fourier features which generates a neural field-based model. The full deep learning architecture is fine-tuned bridging the gap between remote sensing and in situ observations. Labels are derived from Parker Solar Probe measurements, forming a downstream classification task that maps plasma properties to solar wind structures. Although overall classification performance is modest, likely due to coarse labeling, class imbalance, and limited transferability of the pretrained model, this study demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging foundation model embeddings for in situ solar wind tasks. As a first proof-of-concept, it lays the groundwork for future improvements toward more reliable space weather predictions.

However, current LULC models are typically developed for a specific modality and a fixed class taxonomy, limiting their generability and broader applicability. Recent advances in foundation models (FMs) offer promising opportunities for building universal models. Yet, task-agnostic FMs often require fine-tuning for downstream applications, whereas task-specific FMs rely on massive amounts of labeled data for training, which is costly and impractical in the remote sensing (RS) domain. To address these challenges, we propose LandSegmenter, an LULC FM framework that resolves three-stage challenges at the input, model, and output levels. From the input side, to alleviate the heavy demand on labeled data for FM training, we introduce LAnd Segment (LAS), a large-scale, multi-modal, multi-source dataset built primarily with globally sampled weak labels from existing LULC products. LAS provides a scalable, cost-effective alternative to manual annotation, enabling large-scale FM training across diverse LULC domains. For model architecture, LandSegmenter integrates an RS-specific adapter for cross-modal feature extraction and a text encoder for semantic awareness enhancement. At the output stage, we introduce a class-wise confidence-guided fusion strategy to mitigate semantic omissions and further improve LandSegmenter's zero-shot performance. We evaluate LandSegmenter on six precisely annotated LULC datasets spanning diverse modalities and class taxonomies. Extensive transfer learning and zero-shot experiments demonstrate that LandSegmenter achieves competitive or superior performance, particularly in zero-shot settings when transferred to unseen datasets.

Most CD models assume co-registered inputs, yet real-world imagery often exhibits parallax, viewpoint shifts, and long temporal gaps that cause severe misalignment. Traditional two stage methods that first register and then detect, as well as recent joint frameworks (e.g., BiFA, ChangeRD), still struggle under large displacements, relying on regression only flow, global homographies, or synthetic perturbations. We present DiffRegCD, an integrated framework that unifies dense registration and change detection in a single model. DiffRegCD reformulates correspondence estimation as a Gaussian smoothed classification task, achieving sub-pixel accuracy and stable training. It leverages frozen multi-scale features from a pretrained denoising diffusion model, ensuring robustness to illumination and viewpoint variation. Supervision is provided through controlled affine perturbations applied to standard CD datasets, yielding paired ground truth for both flow and change detection without pseudo labels. Extensive experiments on aerial (LEVIR-CD, DSIFN-CD, WHU-CD, SYSU-CD) and ground level (VL-CMU-CD) datasets show that DiffRegCD consistently surpasses recent baselines and remains reliable under wide temporal and geometric variation, establishing diffusion features and classification based correspondence as a strong foundation for unified change detection.",

    "abstract": "Geospatial foundation models for Earth observation often fail to perform reliably in environments underrepresented during pretraining. We introduce SHRUG-FM, a framework for reliability-aware prediction that integrates three complementary signals: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in the input space, OOD detection in the embedding space and task-specific predictive uncertainty. Applied to burn scar segmentation, SHRUG-FM shows that OOD scores correlate with lower performance in specific environmental conditions, while uncertainty-based flags help discard many poorly performing predictions. Linking these flags to land cover attributes from HydroATLAS shows that failures are not random but concentrated in certain geographies, such as low-elevation zones and large river areas, likely due to underrepresentation in pretraining data. SHRUG-FM provides a pathway toward safer and more interpretable deployment of GFMs in climate-sensitive applications, helping bridge the gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability.",

    "abstract": "Reliable geospatial information on road accidents is vital for safety analysis and infrastructure planning, yet most low- and middle-income countries continue to face a critical shortage of accurate, location-specific crash data. Existing text-based geocoding tools perform poorly in multilingual and unstructured news environments, where incomplete place descriptions and mixed Bangla-English scripts obscure spatial context. To address these limitations, this study introduces ALIGN (Accident Location Inference through Geo-Spatial Neural Reasoning)- a vision-language framework that emulates human spatial reasoning to infer accident coordinates directly from textual and map-based cues. ALIGN integrates large language and vision-language models within a multi-stage pipeline that performs optical character recognition, linguistic reasoning, and map-level verification through grid-based spatial scanning. The framework systematically evaluates each predicted location against contextual and visual evidence, ensuring interpretable, fine-grained geolocation outcomes without requiring model retraining. Applied to Bangla-language news data, ALIGN demonstrates consistent improvements over traditional geoparsing methods, accurately identifying district and sub-district-level crash sites. Beyond its technical contribution, the framework establishes a high accuracy foundation for automated crash mapping in data-scarce regions, supporting evidence-driven road-safety policymaking and the broader integration of multimodal artificial intelligence in transportation analytics.

In this work, we propose a physics-informed Transformer-VAE architecture to invert the PROSAIL radiative transfer model for simultaneous estimation of key canopy parameters from Sentinel-2 data. Unlike previous hybrid approaches that require real satellite images for self-supevised training. Our model is trained exclusively on simulated data, yet achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art methods that utilize real imagery. The Transformer-VAE incorporates the PROSAIL model as a differentiable physical decoder, ensuring that inferred latent variables correspond to physically plausible leaf and canopy properties. We demonstrate retrieval of leaf area index (LAI) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) on real-world field datasets (FRM4Veg and BelSAR) with accuracy comparable to models trained with real Sentinel-2 data. Our method requires no in-situ labels or calibration on real images, offering a cost-effective and self-supervised solution for global vegetation monitoring. The proposed approach illustrates how integrating physical models with advanced deep networks can improve the inversion of RTMs, opening new prospects for large-scale, physically-constrained remote sensing of vegetation traits.",

To mitigate this limitation, numerous studies have been conducted to enhance the resolutions of LST data, with a particular emphasis on the spatial dimension (commonly known as LST downscaling). Nevertheless, a comprehensive benchmark dataset tailored for this task remains scarce. In addition, existing downscaling models face challenges related to accuracy, practical usability, and the capability to self-evaluate their uncertainties. To overcome these challenges, this study first compiled three representative datasets, including one dataset over mainland China containing 22,909 image patches for model training and evaluation, as well as two datasets covering 40 heterogeneous regions worldwide for external evaluation. Subsequently, grounded in the surface energy balance (SEB)-based geophysical reasoning, we proposed the physically guided diffusion model (PGDM) for LST downscaling. In this framework, the downscaling task was formulated as an inference problem, aiming to sample from the posterior distribution of high-spatial-resolution (HR) LST conditioned on low-spatial-resolution (LR) LST observations and a suite of HR geophysical priors. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of PGDM, which generates high-quality downscaling results and outperforms existing representative interpolation, kernel-driven, hybrid, and deep learning approaches. Finally, by exploiting the inherent stochasticity of PGDM, the scene-level standard deviation of multiple generations was computed, revealing a strong positive linear correlation with the actual downscaling error...",

This study introduces a remote sensing-driven framework to quantify WASH accessibility-specifically to water pumps, latrines, and bathing cubicles-in the Rohingya camps of Cox's Bazar, one of the world's most densely populated displacement settings. Detecting refugee shelters in such emergent camps presents substantial challenges, primarily due to their dense spatial configuration and irregular geometric patterns. Using sub-meter satellite images, we develop a semi-supervised segmentation framework that achieves an F1-score of 76.4% in detecting individual refugee shelters. Applying the framework across multi-year data reveals declining WASH accessibility, driven by rapid refugee population growth and reduced facility availability, rising from 25 people per facility in 2022 to 29.4 in 2025. Gender-disaggregated analysis further shows that women and girls experience reduced accessibility, in scenarios with inadequate safety-related segregation in WASH facilities. These findings suggest the importance of demand-responsive allocation strategies that can identify areas with under-served populations-such as women and girls-and ensure that limited infrastructure serves the greatest number of people in settings with fixed or shrinking budgets. We also discuss the value of high-resolution remote sensing and machine learning to detect inequality and inform equitable resource planning in complex humanitarian environments.",

These observations constrain the upper ocean and minimally influence the deep ocean. Nevertheless, development of the full water column circulation critically depends upon the dynamical interactions between upper and deep fields. Forecasts demonstrate that the initialization of the deep field is influential for the development and evolution of the surface in the forecast. Deep initial conditions that better agree with observations have lower upper ocean uncertainty as the forecast progresses. Here, best and worst ensemble members in two 92-day forecasts are identified and contrasted in order to determine how the deep ocean differs between these groups. The forecasts cover the duration of the Loop Current Eddy Thor separation event, which coincides with available deep observations in the Gulf. Model member performance is assessed by comparing surface variables against verifying analysis and satellite altimeter data during the forecast time-period. Deep cyclonic and anticyclonic features are reviewed, and compared against deep observations, indicating subtle differences in locations of deep eddies at relevant times. These results highlight both the importance of deep circulation in the dynamics of the Loop Current system and more broadly motivate efforts to assimilate deep observations to better constrain the deep initial fields and improve surface predictions.",

A proposed subset, Hycean planets, would have liquid water oceans and be potentially habitable, but there are many unanswered questions about their atmospheric dynamics and 3D climate states. To explore such climates in detail, we report a General Circulation Model (GCM) for Hycean worlds, building on a modified version of the ExoCAM GCM. Considering the temperate sub-Neptune K2-18 b as a Hycean candidate, we implement GCMs with different surface pressures and albedos. We find dynamical structures similar to those of tidally-locked terrestrial planets as `slow rotators' with either one equatorial or twin mid-latitude zonal jets. We see moist convective inhibition that matches high resolution models, although in hotter cases the inhibited zone is subsaturated. When imposing a top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) Bond albedo ($A_b$) by modifying the incident stellar flux, we find that the threshold for K2-18~b to not enter a runaway greenhouse state is $A_b \\geq 0.55$ for a 1 bar atmosphere, consistent with previous studies, and $A_b \\geq 0.8$ for a 5 bar atmosphere. However, a more realistic treatment of the albedo, by modelling scattering within the atmosphere using an enhanced Rayleigh parametrisation, leads to lower lapse rates and stronger thermal inversions. We find that 1 bar atmospheres are stable for an albedo of $A_b \\geq 0.27$, 5 bar atmospheres for $A_b \\geq 0.35$, and 10 bar atmospheres for $A_b \\geq 0.48$. Moderate albedos such as these are typical of the solar system planets and the required scattering is consistent with observational constraints for K2-18~b, supporting its plausibility as a Hycean world.",

The bombardment of the particles dissociates water molecules on the surface of Europa and introduces impurities to the icy surface. Such processes lead to the generation of the non-water species on the surface of Europa. Such processes lead to the generation of the nonwater species on the surface of Europa. These chemical species are closely related to the chemistry of the icy crust and the subsurface ocean, as well as Europa's habitability. However, our knowledge of the global distribution of these species is limited due to the sparse satellite and telescope observations on Europa. In this study, we combine a Europa plasma model and a chemical-transport model to simulate the global distribution of the key nonwater species on the surface of Europa. The initial results from our model agree well with the existing observations on the distributions of H2SO4 and SO2 but they show a significant discrepancy with the observed distribution of H2O2. Sensitivity tests on the reaction rate coefficients indicate that the simulated global distribution of all three species fit the observations well if the reaction rate coefficients in the ice are reduced by one order of magnitude. This finding provides a useful constraint on the rate coefficient of the chemical reactions in the ice. Furthermore, our model predicts that the O2 on the surface ice of Europa is concentrated on the leading hemisphere. The simulated global distribution of the key species on Europa may provide useful guidance for future missions to Europa, such as Europa Clipper and JUICE.",

We propose a flexible Bayesian spatiotemporal site-occupancy model that aims to mimic the data-generating process that underlies common citizen science datasets sourced from public biodiversity portals, and yields rich biological output. We illustrate the use of the model to a dataset containing over 3M butterfly records in Belgium, collected through the citizen science data portal Observations.be. We show that the proposed approach enables retrospective predictions on the occupancy of species through time and space at high resolution, as well as inference on inter-annual distributional trends, range dynamics, habitat preferences, phenological patterns, detection patterns and observer heterogeneity. The proposed model can be used to increase the value of opportunistically collected data by naturalists and citizen scientists, and can aid the understanding of spatiotemporal dynamics of species for which rigorously collected data are absent or too costly to collect.",

Successively, we analyze the chemical composition of silicates depending on spatial region in the disk and identify several silicate species commonly found in protoplanetary disks. Additionally, a depletion of amorphous dust grains toward the central protostar is observed. Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations show that hot dust close to the protostar and in the line of sight to the observer, either in the uppermost disk layers of a strongly flared disk or in a dusty envelope, is necessary to model the observations. The shadow cast by a dense innermost disk midplane on the dust further out explains the observed closure phases in the L band and to some extent in the M band. However, the closure phases in the N band are underestimated by our model, hinting at an additional asymmetry in the flux density distribution not visible at shorter wavelengths.",

In bioacoustics, calibration is challenged by overlapping vocalisations, long-tailed species distributions, and distribution shifts between training and deployment data. The calibration of multi-label deep learning classifiers within the domain of bioacoustics has not yet been assessed. We systematically benchmark the calibration of four state-of-the-art multi-label bird sound classifiers on the BirdSet benchmark, evaluating both global, per-dataset and per-class calibration using threshold-free calibration metrics (ECE, MCS) alongside discrimination metrics (cmAP). Model calibration varies significantly across datasets and classes. While Perch v2 and ConvNeXt$_{BS}$ show better global calibration, results vary between datasets. Both models indicate consistent underconfidence, while AudioProtoPNet and BirdMAE are mostly overconfident. Surprisingly, calibration seems to be better for less frequent classes. Using simple post hoc calibration methods we demonstrate a straightforward way to improve calibration. A small labelled calibration set is sufficient to significantly improve calibration with Platt scaling, while global calibration parameters suffer from dataset variability. Our findings highlight the importance of evaluating and improving uncertainty calibration in bioacoustic classifiers.",

    "abstract": "Geospatial Foundation Models (GeoFMs) are transforming Earth Observation (EO), but evaluation lacks standardized protocols. GEO-Bench-2 addresses this with a comprehensive framework spanning classification, segmentation, regression, object detection, and instance segmentation across 19 permissively-licensed datasets. We introduce ''capability'' groups to rank models on datasets that share common characteristics (e.g., resolution, bands, temporality). This enables users to identify which models excel in each capability and determine which areas need improvement in future work. To support both fair comparison and methodological innovation, we define a prescriptive yet flexible evaluation protocol. This not only ensures consistency in benchmarking but also facilitates research into model adaptation strategies, a key and open challenge in advancing GeoFMs for downstream tasks.\n  Our experiments show that no single model dominates across all tasks, confirming the specificity of the choices made during architecture design and pretraining. While models pretrained on natural images (ConvNext ImageNet, DINO V3) excel on high-resolution tasks, EO-specific models (TerraMind, Prithvi, and Clay) outperform them on multispectral applications such as agriculture and disaster response. These findings demonstrate that optimal model choice depends on task requirements, data modalities, and constraints. This shows that the goal of a single GeoFM model that performs well across all tasks remains open for future research.

    "abstract": "Synthesizing high-fidelity and controllable 4D LiDAR data is crucial for creating scalable simulation environments for autonomous driving. This task is inherently challenging due to the sensor's unique spherical geometry, the temporal sparsity of point clouds, and the complexity of dynamic scenes. To address these challenges, we present LiSTAR, a novel generative world model that operates directly on the sensor's native geometry. LiSTAR introduces a Hybrid-Cylindrical-Spherical (HCS) representation to preserve data fidelity by mitigating quantization artifacts common in Cartesian grids. To capture complex dynamics from sparse temporal data, it utilizes a Spatio-Temporal Attention with Ray-Centric Transformer (START) that explicitly models feature evolution along individual sensor rays for robust temporal coherence. Furthermore, for controllable synthesis, we propose a novel 4D point cloud-aligned voxel layout for conditioning and a corresponding discrete Masked Generative START (MaskSTART) framework, which learns a compact, tokenized representation of the scene, enabling efficient, high-resolution, and layout-guided compositional generation. Comprehensive experiments validate LiSTAR's state-of-the-art performance across 4D LiDAR reconstruction, prediction, and conditional generation, with substantial quantitative gains: reducing generation MMD by a massive 76%, improving reconstruction IoU by 32%, and lowering prediction L1 Med by 50%. This level of performance provides a powerful new foundation for creating realistic and controllable autonomous systems simulations. Project link: https://ocean-luna.github.io/LiSTAR.gitub.io.",

This article introduces ChangeDINO, an end-to-end multiscale Siamese framework for optical building change detection. The model fuses a lightweight backbone stream with features transferred from a frozen DINOv3, yielding semantic- and context-rich pyramids even on small datasets. A spatial-spectral differential transformer decoder then exploits multi-scale absolute differences as change priors to highlight true building changes and suppress irrelevant responses. Finally, a learnable morphology module refines the upsampled logits to recover clean boundaries. Experiments on four public benchmarks show that ChangeDINO consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in IoU and F1, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component.

    "abstract": "Remote sensing Water Body Change Detection (WBCD) aims to detect water body surface changes from bi-temporal images of the same geographic area. Recently, the scarcity of high spatial resolution datasets for WBCD restricts its application in urban and rural regions, which require more accurate positioning. Meanwhile, previous deep learning-based methods fail to comprehensively exploit the spatial semantic and structural information in deep features in the change detection networks. To resolve these concerns, we first propose a new dataset, HSRW-CD, with a spatial resolution higher than 3 meters for WBCD. Specifically, it contains a large number of image pairs, widely covering various water body types. Besides, a Spatial Semantics and Continuity Perception (SSCP) attention module is designed to fully leverage both the spatial semantics and structure of deep features in the WBCD networks, significantly improving the discrimination capability for water body. The proposed SSCP has three components: the Multi-Semantic spatial Attention (MSA), the Structural Relation-aware Global Attention (SRGA), and the Channel-wise Self-Attention (CSA). The MSA enhances the spatial semantics of water body features and provides precise spatial semantic priors for the CSA. Then, the SRGA further extracts spatial structure to learn the spatial continuity of the water body. Finally, the CSA utilizes the spatial semantic and structural priors from the MSA and SRGA to compute the similarity across channels. Specifically designed as a plug-and-play module for water body deep features, the proposed SSCP allows integration into existing WBCD models. Numerous experiments conducted on the proposed HSRW-CD and Water-CD datasets validate the effectiveness and generalization of the SSCP. The code of this work and the HSRW-CD dataset will be accessed at https://github.com/QingMa1/SSCP.",

This study introduces SpectralTrain, a universal, architecture-agnostic training framework that enhances learning efficiency by integrating curriculum learning (CL) with principal component analysis (PCA)-based spectral downsampling. By gradually introducing spectral complexity while preserving essential information, SpectralTrain enables efficient learning of spectral -- spatial patterns at significantly reduced computational costs. The framework is independent of specific architectures, optimizers, or loss functions and is compatible with both classical and state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Indian Pines, Salinas-A, and the newly introduced CloudPatch-7 -- demonstrate strong generalization across spatial scales, spectral characteristics, and application domains. The results indicate consistent reductions in training time by 2-7x speedups with small-to-moderate accuracy deltas depending on backbone. Its application to cloud classification further reveals potential in climate-related remote sensing, emphasizing training strategy optimization as an effective complement to architectural design in HSI models.

    "abstract": "Monocular height estimation plays a critical role in 3D perception for remote sensing, offering a cost-effective alternative to multi-view or LiDAR-based methods. While deep learning has significantly advanced the capabilities of monocular height estimation, these methods remain fundamentally limited by the availability of labeled data, which are expensive and labor-intensive to obtain at scale. The scarcity of high-quality annotations hinders the generalization and performance of existing models. To overcome this limitation, we propose leveraging large volumes of unlabeled data through a semi-supervised learning framework, enabling the model to extract informative cues from unlabeled samples and improve its predictive performance. In this work, we introduce TSE-Net, a self-training pipeline for semi-supervised monocular height estimation. The pipeline integrates teacher, student, and exam networks. The student network is trained on unlabeled data using pseudo-labels generated by the teacher network, while the exam network functions as a temporal ensemble of the student network to stabilize performance. The teacher network is formulated as a joint regression and classification model: the regression branch predicts height values that serve as pseudo-labels, and the classification branch predicts height value classes along with class probabilities, which are used to filter pseudo-labels. Height value classes are defined using a hierarchical bi-cut strategy to address the inherent long-tailed distribution of heights, and the predicted class probabilities are calibrated with a Plackett-Luce model to reflect the expected accuracy of pseudo-labels. We evaluate the proposed pipeline on three datasets spanning different resolutions and imaging modalities. Codes are available at https://github.com/zhu-xlab/tse-net.",

However, there remains a lack of systematic evaluation of whether the demolished land has been effectively reused, raising concerns about the efficacy and sustainability of current redevelopment practices. To address the gap, this study proposes a deep learning-based framework to monitor the spatiotemporal changes of UVs in China. Specifically, semantic segmentation of multi-temporal remote sensing imagery is first used to map evolving UV boundaries, and then post-demolition land use is classified into six categories based on the \"remained-demolished-redeveloped\" phase: incomplete demolition, vacant land, construction sites, buildings, green spaces, and others. Four representative cities from China's four economic regions were selected as the study areas, i.e., Guangzhou (East), Zhengzhou (Central), Xi'an (West), and Harbin (Northeast). The results indicate: 1) UV redevelopment processes were frequently prolonged; 2) redevelopment transitions primarily occurred in peripheral areas, whereas urban cores remained relatively stable; and 3) three spatiotemporal transformation pathways, i.e., synchronized redevelopment, delayed redevelopment, and gradual optimization, were revealed. This study highlights the fragmented, complex and nonlinear nature of UV redevelopment, underscoring the need for tiered and context-sensitive planning strategies. By linking spatial dynamics with the context of redevelopment policies, the findings offer valuable empirical insights that support more inclusive, efficient, and sustainable urban renewal, while also contributing to a broader global understanding of informal settlement transformations.",

    "abstract": "Voxelization is an effective approach to reduce the computational cost of processing Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, yet it results in a loss of fine-scale structural information. This study explores whether low-level voxel content information, specifically target occupancy percentage within a voxel, can be inferred from high-level voxelized LiDAR point cloud data collected from Digital Imaging and remote Sensing Image Generation (DIRSIG) software. In our study, the targets include bark, leaf, soil, and miscellaneous materials. We propose a multi-target regression approach in the context of imbalanced learning using Kernel Point Convolutions (KPConv). Our research leverages cost-sensitive learning to address class imbalance called density-based relevance (DBR). We employ weighted Mean Saquared Erorr (MSE), Focal Regression (FocalR), and regularization to improve the optimization of KPConv. This study performs a sensitivity analysis on the voxel size (0.25 - 2 meters) to evaluate the effect of various grid representations in capturing the nuances of the forest. This sensitivity analysis reveals that larger voxel sizes (e.g., 2 meters) result in lower errors due to reduced variability, while smaller voxel sizes (e.g., 0.25 or 0.5 meter) exhibit higher errors, particularly within the canopy, where variability is greatest. For bark and leaf targets, error values at smaller voxel size datasets (0.25 and 0.5 meter) were significantly higher than those in larger voxel size datasets (2 meters), highlighting the difficulty in accurately estimating within-canopy voxel content at fine resolutions. This suggests that the choice of voxel size is application-dependent. Our work fills the gap in deep imbalance learning models for multi-target regression and simulated datasets for 3D LiDAR point clouds of forests.",

Their short temporal cycles increase the difficulty in automatically detecting them using classical computer vision approaches and remote sensing. Also, due to scarcity of and the difficulty in producing accurate labeled data, automatic detection of ephemeral gullies using Machine Learning is limited to zero-shot approaches which are hard to implement. To overcome these challenges, we present the first weakly supervised pipeline for detection of ephemeral gullies. Our method relies on remote sensing and uses Vision Language Models (VLMs) to drastically reduce the labor-intensive task of manual labeling. In order to achieve that, the method exploits: 1) the knowledge embedded in the VLM's pretraining; 2) a teacher-student model where the teacher learns from noisy labels coming from the VLMs, and the student learns by weak supervision using teacher-generate labels and a noise-aware loss function. We also make available the first-of-its-kind dataset for semi-supervised detection of ephemeral gully from remote-sensed images. The dataset consists of a number of locations labeled by a group of soil and plant scientists, as well as a large number of unlabeled locations. The dataset represent more than 18,000 high-resolution remote-sensing images obtained over the course of 13 years. Our experimental results demonstrate the validity of our approach by showing superior performances compared to VLMs and the label model itself when using weak supervision to train an student model.

A thorough investigation of the error metrics, equation of state, uniaxial tensile deformation, nano-indentation and solid-liquid interface stability for this alloy was carried out, and it is seen that the MTP potential outperforms the popular Modified Embedded Atom Method (MEAM) potential on physical properties prediction.

However, wave-current interactions in their proximity have not been extensively studied. Here we examine the impact of surface currents on the wave field near an ocean eddy dipole. Using the WW3 wave model, we conducted idealized numerical simulations to assess the influence of different configurations on the spatial variability of Significant Wave Height ($H_s$). Additionally, a two-month hindcast of a strong dipole event in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean was performed using three distinct surface current products: SSalto/Duacs, HYCOM NCODA and GlobCurrent. Among these, HYCOM, which incorporates ageostrophic effects, provided a more detailed representation of oceanic energy compared to GlobCurrent and SSalto/Duacs, which primarily reflect geostrophic components. The hindcast assessment employed denoised altimeter-derived $H_s$ data, with a spatial resolution of approximately 6~km. The greatest increase in wave energy occurs in the region between the peak values of positive and negative vorticity, where the opposing surface currents reach their maximum intensity. Therefore, dipoles act as converging lenses for surface waves, channeling their refraction towards the central jet. Despite its poorer spatial and temporal resolutions, SSalto-Duacs surface current data provides more reliable $H_s$ fields, in the study region where geostrophic dynamics are expected to be significant or even dominant.\n  HYCOM captures a broader range of dynamical processes, essential for accurately representing the total energy, though discrepancies with SSalto/Duacs data may arise from assimilation inaccuracies and model limitations.",

We assume that a \"true\" intensity function accurately describes the distribution, while the observed process, resulting from independent thinning, is represented by a degraded intensity. The detection function controls the thinning mechanism, influenced by the object's location and other detection-related features. We use manual identification of holothurians as our benchmark.

    "abstract": "Chemical reaction networks are central to all chemical models. Each rate coefficient has an associated uncertainty, which is generally not taken into account when calculating the chemistry. We performed the first uncertainty analysis of a chemical model of C-rich and O-rich AGB outflows using the Rate22 reaction network. Quantifying the error on the model predictions enables us to determine the need for adding complexity to the model. Using a Monte Carlo sampling method, we quantified the impact of the uncertainties on the chemical kinetic data on the predicted fractional abundances and column densities. The errors are caused by a complex interplay of reactions forming and destroying each species. Parent species show an error on their envelope sizes, which is not caused by the uncertainty on their photodissociation rate, but rather the chemistry reforming the parent after its photodissociation. Using photodissociation models to estimate the envelope size might be an oversimplification. The error on the CO envelope impacts retrieved mass-loss rates by up to a factor of two. For daughter species, the error on the peak fractional abundance ranges from a factor of a few to three orders of magnitude, and is on average about 10\\% of its value. This error is positively correlated with the error on the column density. The standard model suffices for many species, e.g., the radial distribution of cyanopolyynes and hydrocarbon radicals around IRC +10216. However, including spherical asymmetries, dust-gas chemistry, and photochemistry induced by a close-by stellar companion are still necessary to explain certain observations.",

    "abstract": "Chemical transformations depend not only on the identities of the reacting species but also on the catalytic, environmental, and intermediate conditions under which they occur. Classical binary reaction formalisms usually treat such condi- tions as external annotations, which obscures the genuinely multi-state and multi- parameter character of real chemical processes. In this paper we introduce an axiomatic framework in which a chemical system is modelled by a ternary \u0393-semiring. The elements of the state set represent chemical states, while the parameter set encodes catalytic and environmental conditions. A \u0393- dependent ternary operation is used to describe mediated transformations, treating reactants, intermediates, and mediators as intrinsic arguments of the transformation law. We develop the algebraic axioms governing these mediated interactions and in- terpret their associativity, distributivity, and \u0393-linearity in terms of multi-step path- ways, parallel processes, and controlled environmental dependence. We introduce chemical ideals and \u0393-ideals as algebraic structures modelling reaction-closed sub- systems and pathway-stable domains, and study their prime and semiprime forms. Homomorphisms between TGS-chemical systems are shown to preserve reaction pathways and describe consistent changes of chemical environment. Abstract examples from catalysis, thermodynamic phase control, and field- induced quantum transitions illustrate how familiar chemical phenomena fit within this framework. The resulting theory provides a unified algebraic foundation for multi-parameter chemical behaviour and establishes the structural basis for subse- quent developments involving kinetics, geometric methods, and computational or AI-assisted models.",

Our method employs a Refine-Requery-Reinforce loop, where coarse pseudo-masks are generated from initial points (Refine), improved with self-constructed box prompts (Requery), and embeddings are aligned across iterations to reduce confirmation bias (Reinforce). Without relying on full-mask supervision, our approach progressively enhances SAM's segmentation quality and domain robustness through self-guided prompt adaptation . We evaluate our proposed method on three RSI benchmark datasets, including WHU, HRSID, and NWPU VHR-10, showing that our method consistently surpasses pretrained SAM and recent point-supervised segmentation methods. Our results demonstrate that self-prompting and semantic alignment provide an efficient path towards scalable, point-level adaptation of foundation segmentation models for remote sensing applications.",

Moreover, this paradigm of ever-larger models stands in stark contrast with the principles of sustainable and environmentally responsible AI, as it leads to immense carbon footprints and resource inefficiency. In this work, we present a novel and efficient alternative: an Ensemble-of-Specialists framework for building Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs). Our method decomposes the training process into lightweight, task-specific ConvNeXtV2 specialists that can be frozen and reused. This modular approach offers strong advantages in efficiency, interpretability, and extensibility. Moreover, it naturally supports federated training, pruning, and continuous specialist integration, making it particularly well-suited for collaborative and resource-constrained settings.

Existing methods typically employ CNNs/Transformers to extract visual representations from the given images or incorporate auxiliary tasks to enhance the final results, with weak region awareness and limited temporal alignment. To address these issues, this paper explores the use of the SAM (Segment Anything Model) foundation model to extract region-level representations and inject region-of-interest knowledge into the captioning framework. Specifically, we employ a CNN/Transformer model to extract global-level vision features, leverage the SAM foundation model to delineate semantic- and motion-level change regions, and utilize a specially constructed knowledge graph to provide information about objects of interest. These heterogeneous sources of information are then fused via cross-attention, and a Transformer decoder is used to generate the final natural language description of the observed changes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple widely used benchmark datasets.

However, current remote sensing foundation models are ill-suited to such inputs: full-image encoding exhausts token and memory budgets, while resize-based preprocessing loses fine-grained and answer-critical details. In this context, guiding the model look where it matters before prediction becomes crucial. Therefore, we present ZoomSearch, a training-free, plug-and-play pipeline that decouples 'where to look' from 'how to answer' for Ultra-HR Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering (RS-VQA). ZoomSearch combines Adaptive Multi-Branch Zoom Search, which performs a hierarchical search over image patches to localize query-relevant regions, with Layout-Aware Patch Reassembly, which reorganizes the selected patches into a compact, layout-faithful canvas. We conduct comprehensive experiments on Ultra-HR RS-VQA benchmarks MME-RealWorld-RS and LRS-VQA, comparing against (i) strong general foundation models, (ii) remote sensing foundation models, (iii) Ultra-HR RS-VQA methods, and (iv) plug-and-play search-based VQA methods. When integrated with LLaVA-ov, ZoomSearch attains state-of-the-art accuracy across diverse tasks, improving the LLaVA-ov baseline by 26.3% on LRS-VQA and 114.8\\% on MME-RealWorld-RS.

Second, we develop a Fisher-guided adaptive selection mechanism that operates on this toolbox. This selection is guided by Fisher Information to quantify each module's importance by measuring its contribution to the task-specific gradient flow. It dynamically activates only the most critical modules at the appropriate layers, guiding the gradient flow to maximize adaptation effectiveness and efficiency. Comprehensive experiments validate the efficacy and generalizability of our method, where CrossEarth-Gate achieves state-of-the-art performance across 16 cross-domain benchmarks for RS semantic segmentation.

We find that Sundial, in the zero-shot setting, can outperform a fully trained LSTM provided that the input context window is sufficiently long-specifically, when covering more than one or two full seasonal cycles. This demonstrates, for the first time, that a general-purpose foundation model can surpass specialized supervised models on remote-sensing time series prediction without any task-specific tuning.

We recast local Lipschitz continuity of feature attributions as a network community preservation problem, enabling scalable enforcement of spatially coherent explanations without per-sample neighborhood searches. Experiments on two exemplar tasks (county-level GDP in Fujian, n=83; point-wise housing prices in Seattle, n=21,613) show SX-GeoTree maintains competitive predictive accuracy (within 0.01 $R^{2}$ of decision trees) while improving residual spatial evenness and doubling attribution consensus (modularity: Fujian 0.19 vs 0.09; Seattle 0.10 vs 0.05). Ablation confirms Moran's I and modularity terms are complementary; removing either degrades both spatial residual structure and explanation stability.

However, collecting large-scale annotations is costly and time-consuming, while vast amounts of unlabeled imagery remain underutilized. To address this challenge, we propose a Hierarchical Semi-Supervised Active Learning (HSSAL) framework that integrates semi-supervised learning (SSL) and a novel hierarchical active learning (HAL) in a closed iterative loop. In each iteration, SSL refines the model using both labeled data through supervised learning and unlabeled data via weak-to-strong self-training, improving feature representation and uncertainty estimation. Guided by the refined representations and uncertainty cues of unlabeled samples, HAL then conducts sample querying through a progressive clustering strategy, selecting the most informative instances that jointly satisfy the criteria of scalability, diversity, and uncertainty. This hierarchical process ensures both efficiency and representativeness in sample selection. Extensive experiments on three benchmark RS scene classification datasets, including UCM, AID, and NWPU-RESISC45, demonstrate that HSSAL consistently outperforms SSL- or AL-only baselines. Remarkably, with only 8%, 4%, and 2% labeled training data on UCM, AID, and NWPU-RESISC45, respectively, HSSAL achieves over 95% of fully-supervised accuracy, highlighting its superior label efficiency through informativeness exploitation of unlabeled data.

This amplified response leads to biases in simulating extremes, notably an overestimation of atmospheric blocking frequency and duration with the underestimation of peak intensity.

Learning their governing dynamics remains a central challenge in scientific machine learning. Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) provides a simple, data-driven approximation, but practical use is limited by sparse/noisy observations from continuous fields, reliance on linear approximations, and the lack of principled uncertainty quantification. To address these issues, we introduce Stochastic NODE-DMD, a probabilistic extension of DMD that models continuous-time, nonlinear dynamics while remaining interpretable. Our approach enables continuous spatiotemporal reconstruction at arbitrary coordinates and quantifies predictive uncertainty. Across four benchmarks, a synthetic setting and three physics-based flows, it surpasses a baseline in reconstruction accuracy when trained from only 10% observation density. It further recovers the dynamical structure by aligning learned modes and continuous-time eigenvalues with ground truth. Finally, on datasets with multiple realizations, our method learns a calibrated distribution over latent dynamics that preserves ensemble variability rather than averaging across regimes.

At the same time, major questions remain unresolved, including the chemical properties of icy materials, the geological histories of their surfaces, and the coupling between internal evolution and orbital dynamics. Current knowledge of the surfaces, interiors, and atmospheres of the principal icy bodies is built on spacecraft measurements, telescopic observations, laboratory experiments, and theoretical modeling. Recent contributions from Juno, JWST, and stellar occultation studies have added valuable constraints on atmospheric composition, interior structure, and surface activity. Looking ahead, missions such as JUICE, Europa Clipper, Dragonfly, and the Uranus Orbiter and Probe are expected to deliver substantial progress in the study of icy bodies.

This issue is problematic in image restoration for safety-critical domains such as medical imaging, industrial inspection, and remote sensing, where such errors undermine reliability and trust. For example, in low-field MRI, widely used in resource-limited settings, restoration models are essential for enhancing low-quality scans, yet hallucinations can lead to serious diagnostic errors. Progress has been hindered by a circular dependency: evaluating hallucinations requires labeled data, yet such labels are costly and subjective. We introduce HalluGen, a diffusion-based framework that synthesizes realistic hallucinations with controllable type, location, and severity, producing perceptually realistic but semantically incorrect outputs (segmentation IoU drops from 0.86 to 0.36). Using HalluGen, we construct the first large-scale hallucination dataset comprising 4,350 annotated images derived from 1,450 brain MR images for low-field enhancement, enabling systematic evaluation of hallucination detection and mitigation. We demonstrate its utility in two applications: (1) benchmarking image quality metrics and developing Semantic Hallucination Assessment via Feature Evaluation (SHAFE), a feature-based metric with soft-attention pooling that improves hallucination sensitivity over traditional metrics; and (2) training reference-free hallucination detectors that generalize to real restoration failures. Together, HalluGen and its open dataset establish the first scalable foundation for evaluating hallucinations in safety-critical image restoration.",

    "abstract": "Existing deep learning methods for remote sensing image fusion often suffer from poor generalization when applied to unseen datasets due to the limited availability of real training data and the domain gap between different satellite sensors. To address this challenge, we explore the potential of foundation models by proposing a novel pretraining strategy that leverages large-scale simulated datasets to learn robust spatial-spectral priors. Specifically, our approach first constructs diverse simulated datasets by applying various degradation operations (blur, noise, downsampling) and augmentations (bands generation, channel shuffling, high-pass filtering, color jittering, etc.) to natural images from ImageNet and remote sensing images from SkyScript. We then pretrain fusion models on these simulated data to learn generalizable spatial-spectral representations. The pretrained models are subsequently evaluated on six datasets (WorldView-2/3/4, IKONOS, QuickBird, GaoFen-2) using zero-shot and one-shot paradigms, with both full- and freeze-tuning approaches for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on different network architectures including convolutional neural networks, Transformer, and Mamba demonstrate that our pretraining strategy significantly improves generalization performance across different satellite sensors and imaging conditions for various fusion models. The pretrained models achieve superior results in zero-shot scenarios and show remarkable adaptation capability with minimal real data in one-shot settings. Our work provides a practical solution for cross-domain pansharpening, establishes a new benchmark for generalization in remote sensing image fusion tasks, and paves the way for leveraging foundation models through advanced training strategies.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of large vision-language models (VLMs) has significantly enhanced the efficiency and flexibility of geospatial interpretation. However, general-purpose VLMs remain suboptimal for remote sensing (RS) tasks. Existing geospatial VLMs typically adopt a unified modeling strategy and struggle to differentiate between task types and interpretation granularities, limiting their ability to balance local detail perception and global contextual understanding. In this paper, we present SkyMoE, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) vision-language model tailored for multimodal, multi-task RS interpretation. SkyMoE employs an adaptive router that generates task- and granularity-aware routing instructions, enabling specialized large language model experts to handle diverse sub-tasks. To further promote expert decoupling and granularity sensitivity, we introduce a context-disentangled augmentation strategy that creates contrastive pairs between local and global features, guiding experts toward level-specific representation learning. We also construct MGRS-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple RS interpretation tasks and granularity levels, to evaluate generalization in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments on 21 public datasets demonstrate that SkyMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance across tasks, validating its adaptability, scalability, and superior multi-granularity understanding in remote sensing.",

    "abstract": "Tiny object detection in remote sensing imagery has attracted significant research interest in recent years. Despite recent progress, achieving balanced detection performance across diverse object scales remains a formidable challenge, particularly in scenarios where dense tiny objects and large objects coexist. Although large foundation models have revolutionized general vision tasks, their application to tiny object detection remains unexplored due to the extreme scale variation and density distribution inherent to remote sensing imagery. To bridge this scale gap, we propose ScaleBridge-Det, to the best of our knowledge, the first large detection framework designed for tiny objects, which could achieve balanced performance across diverse scales through scale-adaptive expert routing and density-guided query allocation. Specifically, we introduce a Routing-Enhanced Mixture Attention (REM) module that dynamically selects and fuses scale-specific expert features via adaptive routing to address the tendency of standard MoE models to favor dominant scales. REM generates complementary and discriminative multi-scale representations suitable for both tiny and large objects. Furthermore, we present a Density-Guided Dynamic Query (DGQ) module that predicts object density to adaptively adjust query positions and numbers, enabling efficient resource allocation for objects of varying scales. The proposed framework allows ScaleBridge-Det to simultaneously optimize performance for both dense tiny and general objects without trade-offs. Extensive experiments on benchmark and cross-domain datasets demonstrate that ScaleBridge-Det achieves state-of-the-art performance on AI-TOD-V2 and DTOD, while exhibiting superior cross-domain robustness on VisDrone.",

However, existing IIS methods, primarily designed for natural images, struggle to generalize to remote sensing domains due to limited annotated data and computational overhead. To address these challenges, we proposed RS-ISRefiner, a novel click-based IIS framework tailored for remote sensing images. The framework employs an adapter-based tuning strategy that preserves the general representations of Vision Foundation Models while enabling efficient learning of remote sensing-specific spatial and boundary characteristics. A hybrid attention mechanism integrating convolutional local modeling with Transformer-based global reasoning enhances robustness against scale diversity and scene complexity. Furthermore, an improved probability map modulation scheme effectively incorporates historical user interactions, yielding more stable iterative refinement and higher boundary fidelity. Comprehensive experiments on six remote sensing datasets, including iSAID, ISPRS Potsdam, SandBar, NWPU, LoveDA Urban and WHUBuilding, demonstrate that RS-ISRefiner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art IIS methods in terms of segmentation accuracy, efficiency and interaction cost.

Finally, a section of the Rhine River in Bonn, Germany, is selected for experiment analysis. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is capable of flood modelling and 3D representation within a few hours, the parallel speedup ratio reached 6.45. The intuitive flood scene with 3D city models is beneficial for promoting flood risk communication and is particularly helpful for participants without direct experience of floods to understand its spatiotemporal process.

However, their ability to interpret cartographic maps remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce CartoMapQA, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LVLMs' understanding of cartographic maps through question-answering tasks. The dataset includes over 2000 samples, each composed of a cartographic map, a question (with open-ended or multiple-choice answers), and a ground-truth answer. These tasks span key low-, mid- and high-level map interpretation skills, including symbol recognition, embedded information extraction, scale interpretation, and route-based reasoning. Our evaluation of both open-source and proprietary LVLMs reveals persistent challenges: models frequently struggle with map-specific semantics, exhibit limited geospatial reasoning, and are prone to Optical Character Recognition (OCR)-related errors. By isolating these weaknesses, CartoMapQA offers a valuable tool for guiding future improvements in LVLM architectures. Ultimately, it supports the development of models better equipped for real-world applications that depend on robust and reliable map understanding, such as navigation, geographic search, and urban planning.

We reformulate wind forecasting as observation-informed correction of a global numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. Rather than forecasting winds directly, we learn local correction patterns by assimilating the latest in-situ observations to adjust the Global Forecast System (GFS) output. We propose a transformer-based deep learning architecture that (i) handles irregular and time-varying observation sets through masking and set-based attention mechanisms, (ii) conditions predictions on recent observation-forecast pairs via cross-attention, and (iii) employs cyclical time embeddings and coordinate-aware location representations to enable single-pass inference at arbitrary spatial coordinates. We evaluate our model over the Atlantic Ocean using observations from the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) as reference. The model reduces GFS 10-meter wind RMSE at all lead times up to 48 hours, achieving 45% improvement at 1-hour lead time and 13% improvement at 48-hour lead time. Spatial analyses reveal the most persistent improvements along coastlines and shipping routes, where observations are most abundant. The tokenized architecture naturally accommodates heterogeneous observing platforms (ships, buoys, tide gauges, and coastal stations) and produces both site-specific predictions and basin-scale gridded products in a single forward pass. These results demonstrate a practical, low-latency post-processing approach that complements NWP by learning to correct systematic forecast errors.",

NORi stands for neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) Richardson number (Ri) closure. The physical parameterization is controlled by a Richardson number-dependent diffusivity and viscosity. The NODEs are trained to capture the entrainment through the base of the boundary layer, which cannot be represented with a local diffusive closure. The parameterization is trained using large-eddy simulations in an \"a posteriori\" fashion, where parameters are calibrated with a loss function that explicitly depends on the actual time-integrated variables of interest rather than the instantaneous subgrid fluxes, which are inherently noisy. NORi is designed for the realistic nonlinear equation of state of seawater and demonstrates excellent prediction and generalization capabilities in capturing entrainment dynamics under different convective strengths, oceanic background stratifications, rotation strengths, and surface wind forcings. NORi is numerically stable for at least 100 years of integration time in large-scale simulations, despite only being trained on 2-day horizons, and can be run with time steps as long as one hour. The highly expressive neural networks, combined with a physically-rigorous base closure, prove to be a robust paradigm for designing parameterizations for climate models where data requirements are drastically reduced, inference performance can be directly targeted and optimized, and numerical stability is implicitly encouraged during training.",

We present a statistical method to do so in regions where internal-wave signals are negligible, such as western boundary current regions and the Southern Ocean. Our method assumes Gaussian statistics for both the balanced flow and the noise, which we infer by fitting parametric models to the observed SSH wavenumber spectrum. Using these inferred parameters, we perform a Bayesian inversion to reconstruct swath-aligned SSH maps that fill the nadir gap. We evaluate the method using synthetic data from a high-resolution simulation with realistic SWOT-like noise added. Comparisons with the underlying model data show that our reconstruction successfully removes small-scale noise while preserving meso- and submesoscale eddies, fronts, and filaments down to a feature scale of 10km. The comparison also demonstrates that the posterior uncertainty is a reliable estimate of the error.",

For the two-patch scenario, by treating edge behavior at the interface as a strategy, it has been shown that there exists an ideal free distribution (IFD) strategy, which is a globally evolutionarily stable strategy. Specifically, when the resident species follows the IFD strategy and the mutant species does not, the mutant species is unable to invade the resident population. Building on this foundation, our work focuses on exploring the dynamics of the system when neither species can adopt the IFD strategy. We demonstrate that if the strategies of both species either exceed or fall below the IFD strategy, the mutant species can outcompete and eliminate the resident species, provided that its strategy is closer to the IFD strategy and its diffusion rates are equal to or slower than those of the resident species. Furthermore, if the strategies of the two species lie on opposite sides of the IFD strategy, the two species can coexist.

    "abstract": "Environmental variables are increasingly affecting agricultural decision-making, yet accessible and scalable tools for soil assessment remain limited. This study presents a robust and scalable modeling system for estimating soil properties in croplands, including soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P), exchangeable potassium (K), and pH, using remote sensing data and environmental covariates. The system employs a hybrid modeling approach, combining the indirect methods of modeling soil through proxies and drivers with direct spectral modeling. We extend current approaches by using interpretable physics-informed covariates derived from radiative transfer models (RTMs) and complex, nonlinear embeddings from a foundation model. We validate the system on a harmonized dataset that covers Europes cropland soils across diverse pedoclimatic zones. Evaluation is conducted under a robust validation framework that enforces strict spatial blocking, stratified splits, and statistically distinct train-test sets, which deliberately make the evaluation harder and produce more realistic error estimates for unseen regions. The models achieved their highest accuracy for SOC and N. This performance held across unseen locations, under both spatial cross-validation and an independent test set. SOC obtained a MAE of 5.12 g/kg and a CCC of 0.77, and N obtained a MAE of 0.44 g/kg and a CCC of 0.77. We also assess uncertainty through conformal calibration, achieving 90 percent coverage at the target confidence level. This study contributes to the digital advancement of agriculture through the application of scalable, data-driven soil analysis frameworks that can be extended to related domains requiring quantitative soil evaluation, such as carbon markets.",

    "abstract": "Glacial lake monitoring bears great significance in mitigating the anticipated risk of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods. However, existing segmentation methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), remain constrained to pixel-level predictions, lacking high-level global scene semantics and human-interpretable reasoning. To address this, we introduce GLACIA (\\textbf{G}lacial \\textbf{LA}ke segmentation with \\textbf{C}ontextual \\textbf{I}nstance \\textbf{A}wareness), the first framework that integrates large language models with segmentation capabilities to produce both accurate segmentation masks and corresponding spatial reasoning outputs. We construct the Glacial Lake Position Reasoning (GLake-Pos) dataset pipeline, which provides diverse, spatially grounded question-answer pairs designed to overcome the lack of instance-aware positional reasoning data in remote sensing. Comparative evaluation demonstrate that GLACIA (mIoU: 87.30) surpasses state-of-the-art method based on CNNs (mIoU: 78.55 - 79.01), ViTs (mIoU: 69.27 - 81.75), Geo-foundation models (mIoU: 76.37 - 87.10), and reasoning based segmentation methods (mIoU: 60.12 - 75.66). Our approach enables intuitive disaster preparedness and informed policy-making in the context of rapidly changing glacial environments by facilitating natural language interaction, thereby supporting more efficient and interpretable decision-making.

However, processing large volume world-wide road network data requires intensive computing resources and the processed results might be different to be unified for testing downstream tasks. Therefore, in this paper, we process the OpenStreetMap data via a distributed computing of 5,000 cores on cloud services and release a structured world-wide 1-billion-vertex road network graph dataset with high accessibility (opensource and downloadable to the whole world) and usability (open-box graph structure and easy spatial query interface). To demonstrate how this dataset can be utilized easily, we present three illustrative use cases, including traffic prediction, city boundary detection and traffic policy control, and conduct extensive experiments for these three tasks. (1) For the well-investigated traffic prediction tasks, we release a new benchmark with 31 cities (traffic data processed and combined with our released OSM+ road network dataset), to provide much larger spatial coverage and more comprehensive evaluation of compared algorithms than the previously frequently-used datasets. This new benchmark will push the algorithms on their scalability from hundreds of road network intersections to thousands of intersections. (2) While for the more advanced traffic policy control task which requires interaction with the road network, we release a new 6 city datasets with much larger scale than the previous datasets. This brings new challenge for thousand-scale multi-agent coordination. (3) Along with the OSM+ dataset, the release of data converters facilitates the integration of multimodal spatial-temporal data for geospatial foundation model training, thereby expediting the process of uncovering compelling scientific insights.

    "abstract": "The subject of this research is the development of an intelligent, integrated framework for the automated inspection of photovoltaic (PV) infrastructure that addresses the critical shortcomings of conventional methods, including thermal palette bias, data redundancy, and high communication bandwidth requirements. The goal of this study is to design, develop, and validate a comprehensive, multi-modal system that fully automates the monitoring workflow, from data acquisition to the generation of actionable, geo-located maintenance alerts, thereby enhancing plant safety and operational efficiency. The methods employed involve a synergistic architecture that begins with a palette-invariant thermal embedding, learned by enforcing representational consistency, which is fused with a contrast-normalized RGB stream via a gated mechanism. This is supplemented by a closed-loop, adaptive re-acquisition controller that uses Rodrigues-based updates for targeted confirmation of ambiguous anomalies and a geospatial deduplication module that clusters redundant alerts using DBSCAN over the haversine distance. In conclusion, this study establishes a powerful new paradigm for proactive PV inspection, with the proposed system achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.903 on the public PVF-10 benchmark, a significant 12-15% improvement over single-modality baselines. Field validation confirmed the system's readiness, achieving 96% recall, while the de-duplication process reduced duplicate-induced false positives by 15-20%, and relevance-only telemetry cut airborne data transmission by 60-70%.",

    "abstract": "Pansharpening aims to fuse a high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) image with a low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) image to generate a high-resolution multispectral image (HRMS). Conventional deep learning-based methods are inherently limited in their ability to adapt to regional heterogeneity within feature representations. Although various adaptive convolution methods have been proposed to address this limitation, they often suffer from excessive computational costs and a limited ability to capture heterogeneous regions in remote sensing images effectively. To overcome these challenges, we propose Bimodal Bi-Adaptive Mask-Aware Convolution (Bi^2MAC), which effectively exploits information from different types of regions while intelligently allocating computational resources. Specifically, we design a lightweight module to generate both soft and hard masks, which are used to modulate the input features preliminarily and to guide different types of regions into separate processing branches, respectively. Redundant features are directed to a compact branch for low-cost global processing. In contrast, heterogeneous features are routed to a focused branch that invests more computational resources for fine-grained modeling. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Bi^2MAC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while requiring substantially lower training time and parameter counts, and the minimal computational cost among adaptive convolution models.",

Machine learning (ML) methods offer increased inference speed and flexibility in capturing prior knowledge of imaging targets relative to classical optimization-based approaches; however, they perform poorly in regimes where the scattering behavior is highly nonlinear. A key limitation is that ML methods struggle to incorporate the physics governing the scattering process, which are typically inferred implicitly from the training data or loosely enforced via architectural design. In this paper, we present a method that endows a machine learning framework with explicit knowledge of problem physics, in the form of a differentiable solver representing the forward model. The proposed method progressively refines reconstructions of the scattering potential using measurements at increasing wave frequencies, following a classical strategy to stabilize recovery. Empirically, we find that our method provides high-quality reconstructions at a fraction of the computational or sampling costs of competing approaches.",

This paper presents a comprehensive roadmap distinguishing it from previous reviews by proposing a unified and modular pipeline that integrates multi-source soil data, GIS and remote sensing tools, and machine learning techniques to support transparent and scalable soil quality assessment. It also includes practical applications. Contrary to existing studies that predominantly target isolated soil parameters or specific modeling methodologies, this approach consolidates recent advancements in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), remote sensing technologies, and machine learning algorithms within the entire soil quality assessment pipeline. It also addresses existing challenges and limitations while exploring future developments and emerging trends in the field that can deliver the next generation of soil quality systems making them more transparent, adaptive, and aligned with sustainable land management.",

    "abstract": "Detecting small objects in UAV remote sensing images and identifying surface defects in industrial inspection remain difficult tasks. These applications face common obstacles: features are sparse and weak, backgrounds are cluttered, and object scales vary dramatically. Current transformer-based detectors, while powerful, struggle with three critical issues. First, features degrade severely as networks downsample progressively. Second, spatial convolutions cannot capture long-range dependencies effectively. Third, standard upsampling methods inflate feature maps unnecessarily.\n  We introduce DFIR-DETR to tackle these problems through dynamic feature aggregation combined with frequency-domain processing. Our architecture builds on three novel components. The DCFA module uses dynamic K-sparse attention, cutting complexity from O(N2) down to O(NK), and employs spatial gated linear units for better nonlinear modeling. The DFPN module applies amplitude-normalized upsampling to prevent feature inflation and uses dual-path shuffle convolution to retain spatial details across scales. The FIRC3 module operates in the frequency domain, achieving global receptive fields without sacrificing efficiency.\n  We tested our method extensively on NEU-DET and VisDrone datasets. Results show mAP50 scores of 92.9% and 51.6% respectively-both state-of-the-art. The model stays lightweight with just 11.7M parameters and 41.2 GFLOPs. Strong performance across two very different domains confirms that DFIR-DETR generalizes well and works effectively in resource-limited settings for cross-scene small object detection.",

In this context, tips are generated from external data sources or analyses of prior satellite imagery, identifying spatiotemporal targets and prioritizing them for downstream planning. Corresponding cues are the imaging tasks formulated in response, which incorporate sensor constraints, timing requirements, and utility functions. The system autonomously generates candidate tasks, optimizes their scheduling across multiple satellites using continuous utility functions that reflect the expected value of each observation, and processes the resulting imagery using artificial-intelligence-based models, including object detectors and vision-language models. Structured visual reports are generated to support both interpretability and the identification of new insights for downstream tasking. The efficacy of the framework is demonstrated through a maritime vessel tracking scenario, utilizing Automatic Identification System (AIS) data for trajectory prediction, targeted observations, and the generation of actionable outputs. Maritime vessel tracking is a widely researched application, often used to benchmark novel approaches to satellite tasking, forecasting, and analysis. The system is extensible to broader applications such as smart-city monitoring and disaster response, where timely tasking and automated analysis are critical.",

To jointly model these species, we develop a multi-species Log-Gaussian Cox Process (LGCP) in which species specific intensity surfaces are linked through a shared latent spatial Gaussian field. This structure allows the model to capture broad spatial patterns common to both species while still accommodating species level responses to environmental covariates and seasonal variation. The latent field is represented using the Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) approach with an anisotropic Matern covariance, implemented on an ocean constrained triangulated mesh so that spatial dependence aligns with marine geography. Whale group size is incorporated through a marked point process extension with species specific negative binomial marks, allowing occurrence and group sizes to be jointly analyzed within a unified framework. Inference is carried out using the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA), enabling efficient model fitting over a decade of survey effort. The results highlight persistent multi-species hotspots and distinct environmental associations for each species, demonstrating the value of shared field LGCPs for joint species distribution modeling in data sparse and heterogeneous survey settings.",
